<p id="date">Circa 1875</p>

<div class="text">
<p> When was growing up I never learned about the Balkan nations. The nations of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, and Montenegro were all just part of the isolationist country of Yugoslavia. These same nations were previously all attached to the Ottoman Empire. Serbia and Montenegro achieved nominal independence from Turkey around 1880. By 1900, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, were absorbed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire, after a brief period of independence. After gaining independence, Serbia remained disposed to dominate the other Balkan states, although it was under strong pressure by Bulgaria to the north, Turkey to the east and Austro-Hungary to the west. The conflict between the Serbs and Austro-Hungary was a critical factor leading to the start of World War I.</p>

<p>At the end of World War I, one of the numerous questionable decisions made by the victorious allies regarding the organization of the post-war world was to create the first Yugoslavia, originally known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. However, there are remarkably polarizing differences among the Balkan peoples, which ultimately made a unified "South Slavic" state an impractical dream.</p>

<p>Axis powers of World War II invaded Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941 and the government surrendered after only 11 days. However, throughout Yugoslavia there was strong resistance, both by Serbian "Chetniks" royalists and communist partisans led by Josip Broz Tito. Ultimately, the two resistance factions turned against each other and the Chetniks were transformed into a Serbian nationalist militia that drew support from the axis rather than the allies. Despite the Chetniks, the communist partisans were able to expel the Axis by 1945, with only limited support from the Red Army, and Marshal Tito was subsequently able to form an independent communist state that remained largely outside of the Soviet block.</p>

<p>By 1990, the entire Soviet world was breaking up and Yugoslavia was itself facing a constitutional crisis. Within two years, what was previously one state became seven and after 500 years of conflict and domination, the old Balkan nations were reborn, unfortunately only to rekindle old animosities. From Yugoslavia was born or reborn: Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Slovenia, and Montenegro. Below is a breakdown of their respective populations (in millions) and religious cross-section (circa 2005) as gleaned from Wikipedia:</p>
<table class="population">
	<tr>
		<td>Bosnia-Herzegovina</td>
		<td>3.9 M</td>
		<td>45% Muslim, 36% Serb Orthodox, 15% Catholic</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Croatia</td>
		<td>3.2 M</td>
		<td><2% Muslim, 4% Serb Orthodox, 86% Catholic</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Kosovo</td>
		<td>1.9 M</td>
		<td>96% Muslim, 4% Christian (various)</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Macedonia</td>
		<td>2.0 M</td>
		<td>33% Muslim, 65% Greek Orthodox</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Montenegro</td>
		<td>0.7 M</td>
		<td>19% Muslim, 80% Serb Orthodox</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Serbia</td>
		<td>7.0 M</td>
		<td>3% Muslim, 84% Serb Orthodox, 6% Catholic</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Slovenia</td>
		<td>2.0 M</td>
		<td>2.4% Muslim, 2% Lutheran, 96% Catholic</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>From the above breakdown, it is apparent that Serbia emerged with a large ethnically distinct population, and additionally there were also substantial minorities in the some of the other Baltic states, particularly Bosnia and Montenegro, who identify themselves as Serbs. While most of the new Balkan states emerged as parliamentary republics, the reborn Serbia was initially controlled by a communist-style dictator, Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ.  Up until the overthrow of MiloÅ¡eviÄ in 2000, the new republics were wracked with wars arising from, or opposing, Serbian policies, which amounted to near genocide in some cases.</p>

<p>The first historical reference to Bosnia appears in Byzantine documents of the 10th century and the name is believed to derive from the Bosna River. The kingdom of Bosnia was established in 1377, with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first Bosnian King. The kingdom lasted for less than 100 years before conquest by the Ottomans in 1463. During the period of Ottoman occupation the native Bosnian Orthodox church disappeared and a large Slavic Muslim population developed who became identified as the Bosniaks.</p>

<p>Herzegovina is believed to have originally referred to the domain of a Bosnian lord Stephen VukÄiÄ KosaÄa who was an Ottoman vassal around the year 1448. The region of the country specifically thought of as Herzegovina is the southern quarter of the roughly triangular republic. In this part of the country the people are mainly Croats (48 percent) with 26 percent Bosniaks and 20 percent Serbs. The people are mainly Christian, Catholic, or Serbian Orthodox.</p>

<p>This knife is from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and more specifically Bosnia.  It is typical of the very short period of independence before the annexation to the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the 19th century. The grips are bone, set with brass nails and inserts, with a flared pommel that is reminiscent of a Turkish <a href="1807-balkan-yataghan.html">yataghan</a>. This type of knife might also be classified as a <a href="1834-bichaq-dagger.html">bichaq</a>, which typically also have flared pommels. The straight, single edge blade is 9.5 inches long.</p>
