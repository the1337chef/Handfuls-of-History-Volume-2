<h1>Chapter 4. Weapons from Islamic Peoples of the Middle East and North Africa</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>This is the first in a series of five chapters that touch upon weapons as elements of culture, ethnographic artifacts. They are, by and large, cultures with which I am not familiar, and the study of any single one could be a life’s work. The scope for each of these chapters is largely defined by geography, and for this chapter two elements make a common theme for the pieces. One is that, although they come from different countries, they belonged to people of the Islamic faith. The second theme is that the geographic area included covers roughly that of the Ottoman and Safavid (modern Persian) Empires at their greatest extents.</p>

<p>As with any faith, the acceptance of Islam is a transforming experience. As Islam came to different parts of the world, its transforming effects varied according to the native peoples, their prior faiths, and, in the case of Islamic conquests, whoever wielded the swords. This chapter deals with peoples living relatively near the birthplace of the Islamic faith, Arabs and some others early converted. Many of the weapons in this chapter are associated with peoples who could be described as “Arab,” meaning that they are speakers of Arabic and perhaps live on the Arabian peninsula. However, even if they speak Arabic, they may also speak another language, Turkish, Kurdish, or even Russian. </p>

<p>The Islamic calendar began in the year 622 CE, approximately 620 years after the birth of Jesus of Nazareth and 590 after his death as the crystallizing martyr of the Christian faith. The world was transformed in many ways during those 600 years. The Roman world that nurtured early Christianity had reached its zenith and in the West already achieved its nadir. Christianity, which arose as a faith of glorifying the meek and submissive, had been transformed as well. In the year 312 the Roman Emperor Constantine took up the Christian cross, and the faith became to be shared by commoners and their kings. Although the common Christians no longer had to fear persecution for their faith, the acceptance of Christianity as the state religion did very little to improve their economic status. Rather, it had the effect of creating a second wealthy privileged class, the clerics.</p>

<p>Christianity grew as a faith well suited to the urban poor of the Roman Empire, teaching that it was appropriate to submit to Caesar. The pastoral (which is not to say pacifist) nomadic and merchant people of the Arabian Peninsula had no use for Christianity. Likewise, although they had common origins with the Jews, the Arabs were excluded from the Jewish faith. The Jews know themselves as a people chosen by their God. One may claim to convert to Judaism, but there is more to being a Jew than the worship of Jehovah. So, through their prophet Muhammed, Allah came to the Arabs, and Allah became a God chosen by his peoples. Islam was not to be a faith passively accepted by a chosen few, but one actively spread to other peoples, and within a relatively short span of years, it spread to many of the Eastern territories once ruled by Rome and beyond into the territories touched by Alexander the Great. Islam is a faith that suited conquerors, so much so that the Mongols and the Turks who came to the Middle East as conquerors often stayed as Islamic rulers, and took Islam with them as they conquered lands further to the east. They conquered first with the sword, but theirs were also among the first armies to use handguns and artillery. By the sixteenth century the three so-called “Gunpowder Empires of the Ottoman,” Safavid and Mughals stretched from Hungary and North Africa to the Bay of Bengal in eastern India. The Safavid Empire extended from Persia into Afghanistan, which was split with the Mughal Empire, Kandahar being Persian and Kubul in the Mughal territory. This chapter will primarily cover weapons from Islamic lands that were formerly parts of the Ottoman and Safavid Empires, but include the whole of Afghanistan. Subsequent chapters will cover parts of the world with rich mosaics of peoples and faiths that frequently include Islam. Islam spread well beyond the Mughal Empire in the east. While the European explorers took the long way to the East Indies and Indochina, across the oceans or around the Horn of Africa, Muslim merchants reached the East centuries earlier, bringing their faith with them.</p>

<p>Several of the pieces in this chapter are knives of the sort classified as “<a href="1800-kurdish-wootz-jambiya.html">jambiyas</a>,” a very traditional type of Islamic dagger, also know more generically in some areas as a “khanjar.” The jambiya has a special significance for Arab peoples because social and tribal identity can be conveyed by the type of jambiya a man carries as part of their native costume. For people of other nations or ethnicities, we find other unique swords or daggers that were part of their cultural identities. We discussed knives associated with the people of <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1888-cretan-knife.html">Crete</a> and the country of <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1930-chilean-corvo.html">Chile</a> in Chapter 2, many others will be discussed in subsequent chapters. </p>
