<p id="date">Circa 1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Georgia, in the south western Caucuses, became part of the Russian Empire in 1801 when King George XII ceded his crown to Czar Alexander I, much to the chagrin of his dowager queen and the rest of his family. The Qatar emperors of Persia contested Russia's claims to the Caucuses and began a war to regain these traditionally Persian domains. After nine years of war, Russia was victorious over Persia and the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan ceded most the territories of the Caucuses, including both Georgia and Dagestan, to Russia. However, the release of Persian claims on these territories in no way guaranteed the acquiescence of the residents to Russian dominion. Russia was able to establish a firm base in Georgia, but the predominately Islamic regions of Dagestan and Chechnya, in the mountainous heart of the Caucuses, as well as the tribes of Circassians on the eastern shores of the Black sea rebelled, dragging Russia into 50 long years of conflict.</p>

<p>Russia actually fought essentially two protracted wars simultaneously. In the East they fought the Circassian tribes and after forty years of conflict, ultimately deported and exiled over 600,000 people who mainly fled to Ottoman Turkey, an outcome that has come to be known as the Circassian genocide. The war in the west, fought in deep forests of Chechnya and on high mountaintops of Dagestan, also dragged on for nearly 30 years.</p>

<p>Dagestan, the "land of mountains," in the southeast Caucuses, borders the Caspian sea and was long considered of strategic importance because the narrow strip of land along the Caspian coast provided one of the most accessible paths for either commerce or invasion between Europe and Asia. This route was exploited in both directions throughout history. The Greater Caucasus Mountains reach closest to the coast at Derbent, a fortress city first established by the Persians in the 6th century BCE, and, over the millennia, Derbent was conquered at various times by Arabs, Mongol, Timurid, Shirvan, and Russian Empires.</p>

<p>While the narrow coast of Dagestan has been a highway to armies for thousands of years, the mountainous interior has provided natural refuges for the native peoples that have allowed them to be largely indifferent towards whatever Emperor might claim to be their current overlord. The mountaineers of Dagestan built their villages, known as auls, like fortresses, houses stacking up the high mountainsides, nearly inaccessible and highly defensible. These fortress auls became homes for people of many different ethnic origins including Avar, Dargin, Kumyk Tartar, Lezgian, Laks, Azerbaijani, Tabasaran, and Cheche. Having essentially no common language, the diverse peoples were only drawn together in the 19th century by the recognition of the Russians as a common enemy, with the Imams of Dagestan calling for a holy war against the infidels.</p>

<p>Aside from the Georgian ruling class, most residents of the Caucuses were Muslim, although generally not very devout or strict in their practice. This was especially the case in Chechnya, west of Dagestan, where many locals still revered ancient pagan gods and only practiced a highly syncretic form of Islam. Islam had a firmer grounding in parts of Dagestan, and the Mullah Mohammed Yaraghi, a Naqshbandi Sufi scholar, trained young men in a way of thinking that promoted strict observance of Sharia, spiritual purification, and the need for jihad against the invading Russians. Followers of these tenants were known as the Murids, a Sufi term meaning "committed ones." The first important Murid to take the holy message to communities through out Dagestan was Qazi Muhammad who was proclaimed the first Imam of Dagestan in 1829. He was supported in his rise to power by his friend and fellow former student, Shamil (also Shamyl). The first Murid capital was the Aul of Gimry where Qazi was born and had his greatest support. While the ultimate goal of the Murid Jihad was the expulsion of the Russians, they also believed that in order for that goal to be achieved, Sharia had to be enforced in all Dagestan, a conviction that in addition to unifying many of the peoples also made them many enemies among the other local rulers. One of their first military campaigns was in fact not against the Russians but against the capital of the Avar Khanate at Khunzakh, in an effort to displace the female leader (khanum), Pakkou-Bekkhe. The Murids were unsuccessful against the Avars on this occasion, and they returned to Gimry to consolidate what forces they could and plan attacks on Russian garrisons in the region of Vladikavkaz. The guerilla tactics they employed were moderately successful but provoked the Russians to attack Gimry.</p>

<p>Like most auls, Gimry was difficult to attack, being on the side of a mountain with no roads for the Russians to easily bring in troops or artillery. The Russians were determined however, and the Russian general noted that there were goat trails on the side of the mountain above the aul. His guides told him that the trails were inaccessible, to which he queried, "Could a dog go there?" "Yes," he was told, to which he replied, "If a dog can go there a Russian soldier can go there." Combining a frontal assault with this approach from the highlands above, the Russians were able to take Gimry.</p>

<p>The first Imam was found dead inside Gimry by the Russian forces along with many of his followers. One of the few Murids to escape was the Imam's friend, Shamil. However, Shamil was badly wounded and was forced into hiding while he recovered. At a time when most of the Murids believed Shamil to be dead, Gamzat-bek was declared the second Imam in 1832. Gamzat-bek made the ill-fated decision to again attack the Avar Khanate that he claimed was supporting the Russians, perhaps looking for a scapegoat to excuse the loss of Gimry. He was successful at capturing the Avar capital of Khunzakh and executed its female ruler Pakkou-Bekkhe. However, this act alienated the Murid leader Hadji Murad, a kinsman to Pakkou-Bekkhe. Hadji Murad swore vendetta against Gamzat-bek and 18 months later killed him.</p>

<p>By the time of Gamzat-bek's assignation, Shamil had established himself as the effective leader of the Murids and was subsequently declared the third Imam of Dagestan. Shamil proved to be a charismatic military and political leader who took his people to both great victories and tragic defeats in a war that persisted until 1859. <i>The Sabres of Paradise</i>, by Lesley Blanch, is a great telling of the stories of Shamyl, the Murid war, and their Russian adversaries. The war took place during the administrations of three Russian Tsars: Alexander I (who reigned 1801-1825), Nicholas I (1825-1855), and Alexander II (1855-1881). The leading Russian commanders were Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov (1816-1827), Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (1844-1853), and Aleksandr Baryatinskiy (1853-1859).</p>

<p>At one critical stage of the war in 1839, the Russians mounted an 80-day siege of the Mountain fort of Akhoulgo. In an attempt to negotiate a way out of a losing situation, Shamil offered his oldest son Djemal-Eddin, who was six at the time, as a hostage, while he escaped in secret with the rest of his family. Djemal-Eddin fared very well in captivity. He was raised in Russia for 15 years and was treated like an aristocrat in the Czar's inner circles. In 1854, Djemal-Eddin was a young officer in the Russian forces occupying Poland when he was sent for and told he was to return home to a land he had forgotten. Nine months earlier, Shamil's forces had captured a group of Georgian princesses, their children, and retainers. The 23 prisoners were kept in a single room in Shamil's seraglio while negotiations were conducted with the Russian and other leaders of the Murids who wanted more money than the Georgian princes could provide. Eventually, Shamil was able to exchange his prisoners for a ransom of 40,000 rubles, a number of captured Murids, and the great prize, Djemal-Eddin. Djemal-Eddin took the exchange in reasonable good spirits, although with no great joy either. He was treated well enough by the Murids upon his return, but never adjusted back to life in the mountains and died within two years of his return, reportedly of "consumption."</p>

<p>The war dragged on, albeit with a hiatus from 1853-1856 during the Crimean War. After the end of the Crimean war, the newly appointed general in charge of all the Caucuses, Aleksandr Baryatinskiy, brought the war back to the Murids with both vigor and clemency toward any tribe who would defect from the Murid cause. After decades of war, many tribes did defect and at the same time that support for the Murid cause began to evaporate, the Russians committed a new army of 250,000 men with better artillery and new percussion rifles. They also cut down the forests of Chechnya, which had sheltered the guerilla warriors of the western tribes, and built roads to transport their artillery into the mountains.</p>

<p>Shamil surrendered in 1859, and he and his family were taken as prisoners into the heart of Russia where they, like Djemal-Eddin before them, were treated very well. Eventually, they were provided luxurious accommodations in Kiev, where the climate was more agreeable to them than that of St. Petersburg. In 1869, Shamil was even granted permission to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. He died in 1879, while visiting the city Medina. Two of his surviving sons became officers in the Russian army, and two others served in the Turkish army.</p>

<p>The saber of the Murid was a <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1850-georgian-shashka.html">shashka</a>, as it was for most horsemen of the Caucuses, and also for the Cossacks who opposed them. Each Murid would additionally have carried a <a href="1870-kindjal.html">kindjal</a> (<a href="1870-qama-kindjal.html">qama</a>). This shashka is reportedly from Dagestan and the invocations to Allah etched onto the blade suggest it would have been suitable for a Murid. The patina of the blade would also be consistent with it coming from the period of the Murid war. It is possible that the handle and pommel might be newer than the blade. Beautiful new shashkas are still being made in Tbilisi, and one skilled Georgian sword smith frequently has examples on offer through eBay. However, the age apparent at the joint of the blade and handle leads me to feel that these pieces have been together for a long time.</p>

<p>I will never be able to say for sure whether or not this was once one of the "Sabres of Paradise," but it evokes the stories and the people who also inspired authors like Pushkin and Tolstoy.</p>

<p>While many of the former states of the Soviet Union have now become independent states, Dagestan remains part of Russia and is its most ethnically heterogeneous republic. However, Dagestan has also recently experienced a rise in of Islamic insurgency, spurred on by teachers preaching the implementation of Sharia, as the shades of Murids persist.</p>
