<p id="date">Circa 1870</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The early Islamic conquests led by Mohammed and the first Caliphs carried the faith under the swords and banners of Allah as far west as Morocco, basically covering all of North Africa that was once part of the Roman Empire. At the same time, the armies of Islam were spreading east through Persia and Afghanistan, following the path of Alexander the Great. There was something unique however, about the armies of the Islamic conquest that made them unlike the other conquering armies of history. Never before in history were conquered people so quickly and extensively assimilated by their conquerors. When the Macedonian armies of Alexander crossed the borders of India, it is unlikely that they were joined by any of the recently conquered people of Afghanistan. Likewise, as the armies of Genghis Khan penetrated into Europe the Mongol ranks were not swelled with new recruits from the conquered peoples. In contrast, while the first soldiers of Islam were Arabs from the homeland of the Prophet, as the faith grew so did the armies grow with new converts. The army that was poised to begin the conquest of Spain in 711 was not an army of just Arabs but was largely made up of Berbers and other North African peoples. These people became known to the Spanish and other Europeans as the "Moors," a name we now associate with Morocco. In my early history classes I learned that spread of Islam into Europe ended when "Charles Martel defeated the Moors at the battle of Tours in 732." The year 732 marked the 100th anniversary of the death of death of Mohammed. To the Spanish, the followers of Islam would always be "Moors," no matter where in the world they lived. Hence, the Islamic tribes of the Philippines came to be known as the <a href="../chapter-7/1800-moro-kampilan.html">Moros</a>.</p>

<p>Existing on the far edge of the Empire of the Arab Caliphs, Morocco became one of the first Islamic states to declare their independence, with the Idrisid dynasty of Moroccan sultans established 739. There followed a sequence of Berber dynasties, and after 1549, a series of Arab-related dynasties that have ruled Morocco. The current Moroccan royal family is of the Alaouite dynasty, which was founded in 1666. The family legitimizes their rule in part by claiming descent from the prophet Muhammad. Interestingly, on December 20, 1777, the kingdom of Morocco became the first state to recognize the sovereignty of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Morocco is at the northwestern border of the region known as the Maghreb. It was one of the most prosperous and strategic areas of North Africa, making it of great interest to the Europeans as they began to make their grab for Africa in the 19th century. Morocco was of special interest to the French due to its proximity to the French colony of Algeria. Likewise, Spain was interested in gaining control of the northern territories of Morocco. As part of a deal amongst the great powers of Europe, formalized as the treaty of Fez in 1912, Germany, Britain, and Italy agreed to declare Morocco a protectorate of Spain and France, in exchange for considerations elsewhere in Africa. The Moroccans were not consulted, but the reigning monarch was allowed to keep his position, though with no real power.</p>

<p>Famously, Morocco provided the launching point for Generalissimo Franco's forces in the Spanish civil war, and he brought Moroccan colonial troops with him from Africa to bolster the forces of Spain's Nationalist armies. Of fictional fame, we find Rick's CafÃ© in the Casablanca of Vichy France. Morocco only gained independence again in February 1956 and remains a constitutional monarchy.</p>

<p>Morocco is unique blend of Arab, African, and Amazigh cultures, Amazigh being the self-name for the pre-Arab Berber tribes. The connection to Arab cultures in evident in the wearing of <a href="1800-kurdish-wootz-jambiya.html">jambiyas</a> by men in native dress, but the distinctive form of the <a href="1900-morrocan-koumaya-jambiya.html">koumaya</a> jambiya also sets the Moroccans apart from the peoples of Arabia. The sword most associated with ruling Arab descendents of Morocco is the nimcha, of which this is an outstanding example. It has strong similarity to the <a href="1870-arab-saif.html">Arab saif</a>, including the basic shape of the grip and adaptation of one of the upper quillions as a knuckle guard. Three features usually distinguish the Arab swords produced on Zanzibar, from the Moroccan swords. The top of the hilt is usually flat on a true nimcha and angled on the examples from Zanzibar. The Zanzibar swords usually have a D shaped guard formed from the lower quillions. Thirdly, the blade is usually attached to grip on the Moroccan swords with a simple rounded stud while there is usually a plate in the shape of a stylized turtle on the Zanzibar swords.</p>

<p>The grip on this beautiful sword is shaped from a solid piece of rhinoceros horn. The clear fibrous structure of the horn is evident. The single edged 34-inch blade is slightly curved with pronounced fullers. It bears a maker's mark and is likely of European origin.</p>

<p>There are also two strings of 11 characters on each side of the blade, which I have not yet been able to identify. They certainly are not identifiable as Arabic or Latin letters. They maybe a local Berber script, but are not readily recognizable from the most common Berber alphabets. Although there are slight differences in the characters in the four lines, it does seem as if each line was intended to be the same. Do they really have a meaning or were they just supposed to make an impression of exotic origin? Why is the same series repeated four times? Were they intended to be invocations of Allah and the Prophet or are they simply gibberish?</p>
