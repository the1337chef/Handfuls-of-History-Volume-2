<div class="text">
<p> <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/bayonets.html">Bayonets</a>, which transform and extend the utility of a military long gun, were especially useful in the era of single-shot, smooth-bore muskets that used black powder as a propellant. The short range and long reloading time of such weapons meant that there was little delay between a potentially accurate discharge of the musket and close personal contact with an approaching enemy.</p>

<p>Matchlocks were among the first widely used military long guns, beginning in the 15th century in Europe. They rely on the use of a slow (about one inch per five minute) burning cord to serve as the match. To fire the gun, the match is lowered into a pan filled with flash powder, either with a snapping lock or by just moving the match holder, known as the serpent, down under spring pressure.  The use of matchlocks spread through the "Gunpowder Empires" of the Ottoman Turks, the Safavid Persians, and Indian Mughals. They were subsequently introduced through other parts of Asia including Japan. While firearm technology advanced beyond the matchlock in Europe by the middle of the 16th century with the introduction of early flintlocks*, matchlocks continued to be used in Asia into the 19th century. A torador, the typical matchlock of India, is shown in the photos along with this sangin, the type of bayonet used with these guns. As with Indian swords and daggers, some torador muskets are ornate works of art that would have been the property of nobles. Other toradors are rather plain and would have been in the hands of the common soldiers in the perpetual wars among the princely states and sultanates, or by the armies of the Mughal Empire. The example shown is sort of in between. Of course by 1720, the most likely human targets for military toradors would have been wearing red coats, whether as British soldiers or as Sepoys in service to the British East India company.</p>

<p>Sangin bayonets usually had a locking ring that is missing on this example but these never worked so well as the socket mountings on Brown Bess muskets. The long arms would rest along the side of the barrel and often had to be wrapped in place semi-permanently with strips of rawhide or similar material. The tip of the sangin is thicker at the tip, as was often the case with <a href="../chapter-5/1856-katar.html">katars</a> and other Indian daggers that might have had to pierce mail or light armor. There is engraving on the blade but nothing very fancy, suggesting that this was indeed a weapon for serious service in the conflicts of 18th-century India.</p>
