<p id="date">Circa 1890</p>

<div class="text">
<p> "I was unable to show my friendship publicly, because my people were ignorant and fanatical. If I showed any inclination toward the English, my people would call me an infidel for joining hands with infidels," Abdur Rahman, Emir of Afghanistan. *</p>

<p>After Afghani <a href="1820-afghani-pulwar.html">pulwars</a> and British <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1838-french-saber.html">sabers</a> crossed in the first Anglo-Afghan War, which ended poorly for the British in 1842, England adopted a policy of "masterful inactivity" in regards to the borders of its Indian colony. However, they were ever mindful of the fact that Russia was continually expanding its hold on the tribal territories to the west of Afghanistan and to the north of India. Both of these regions were considered potential gateways for a Russian invasion of India. In this era, Russia had also been pressing hard against Turkey, acquiring territories in the Caucasus and playing for control of the Black Sea. Other European powers joined with Britain in keeping Russia from the Dardanelles, with France joining in the Crimean war and the Austro-Hungarian Empire joining in the Russo-Turkish War of 1878. However, Britain was largely on its own against Russia in the posturing for power in Asia that became known as the "Great Game."</p>

<p>By 1878, Russia had succeeded at annexing or obliterating many of the tribal Khanates and Emirates on the borders of Afghanistan and was threatening to invade the Afghan frontier city of Herat. The Russians backed down with the threat of British intervention, but Britain's position also depended on the support of the then independent Emirate of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Things were very difficult for the Afghan Emir, Sher Ali, especially when the Russians sent an uninvited "diplomatic" mission to Kabul in 1878. When Sher Ali felt compelled to admit the Russians, the British demanded to send their own envoys. However, the British were denied permission and so they made preparations to send a military force into Kabul. Sher Ali sent his own envoys to the Tsar and fled Kabul for the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif where he died in 1879. Sher Ali's son, Yaqub Khan, who had previously been the governor of Herat, succeeded to the throne. Under pressure, Yaqub Khan signed the treaty of Gandamak, which effectively made Afghanistan a British protectorate. This act was so unpopular with the Afghan people that Yaqub Khan abdicated in favor of his son Mohammad Ayub Khan. To Ayub Khan fell the burden of leading his people in a war against the armies of British India.</p>

<p>When Ayub Khan came to power, an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of the British Envoy Sir Louis Cavagnari and his company. This prompted British reprisals and provoked a major escalation of the war. Ayub Khan's forces defeated the British Army of George Burrows at the Battle of Maiwand, a major defeat for the Anglo-Indian army. However, in order to secure his throne Ayub Khan needed to take the strategic city of Kandahar, which was held at the time by Ayub Khan's cousin Abdur Rahman Khan with support from the British. After two failed attempts to take Kandahar, Ayub Khan fled to Persia where he was captured by the British, and for the rest of his life Ayub Khan was held in exile in India. The British subsequently negotiated a peace with Abdur Rahman Khan that placed him on the throne of Afghanistan. The British agreed to evacuate their troops if Abdur Rahman would abide by the terms of the treaty of Gandamak.</p>

<p>Although the British ultimately prevailed diplomatically, as noted above, they suffered a number of crushing defeats and the treatment of wounded or captured British and non-Muslim Indian soldiers at the hand of the native Afghan women became legendary in the catalog of war atrocities. This led to Kipling's advice in the final verse of his anthem for the British soldier:</p>

<div style="margin: 1em 5em;">
	<p>"When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,</p>

	<p>And the women come out to cut up what remains,</p>

	<p>Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains</p>

	<p>An' go to your God like a soldier."</p>
</div>
<p>After the war, Abdur Rahman remained compliant with the terms of the treaty of Gandamak, although this was not something he was happy to admit to his people, as noted in the quote above. Abdur Rahman's compliance to the treaty did however lead to 40 years of peace between Afghanistan and Britain. While the Emir had to deal with all of the troublesome tribes within his domain, an important provision of the treaty was that Great Britain was solely responsible for Afghanistan's foreign policy. This included any potential confrontations with Russia.</p>

<p>In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Russians continued to push their game further east. They made a feint into Tibet that tricked the British into sending their own sizable expedition all the way to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, only to find the Dali Llama fled and there were no signs of Russian intervention. The Russians did however, make a grab for part of Manchuria, as the Chinese empire was collapsing and being partitioned by the other European powers.</p>

<p>To support their eastern expansion, the Russians extended their railways to reach from Moscow to the Pacific, where they had established a warm water harbor at Port Arthur. Russian expansion brought a new player into the great game, Japan, leading to the Russo-Japanese war (1903-1904). To the shock of all the European powers, Japan soundly defeated Russia in the East, destroying Port Arthur. In panic, Russia had ordered their Baltic fleet to sail two thirds of the way around the world where it was to face the Japanese navy, which effectively consigned the Russian Navy to the bottom of the sea. The Russo-Japanese war was effectively the final act of the Great Game, one from which Imperial Russia would not recover.</p>

<p>During the decades between the first two Anglo-Afghan Wars, Russia and Britain came perilously close to war on a number of occasions. Both sides played the game with intrigue among the mountain highlands and tribal courts, sending merchants, spies, diplomats, and soldiers. Frequently, among caravan goods were gifts intended for tribal leaders, anticipated to impress the locals with the quality of British manufactured items.</p>

<p>This pulwar is a sword that an Afghani chief would be pleased to own, although perhaps he would be nervous about letting it be known to his people if it was a British gift, which from all indications it probably was.</p>

<p>A Royal Arms Factory was established in 1816 in the London borough of Enfield. The Enfield factory primarily produced firearms, including revolvers and rifles like the famous Pattern 1853, the Martini Henry models and later Lee-Enfields (see Handfuls of History Volume 1). In 1820 they also began to make bayonets and swords. British officers purchased their own swords, usually made by firms such as Wilkinson and marketed through various outfitters in London and elsewhere. However, the swords produced at Enfield were primarily for issue to the rank and file. The blade of this unique pulwar resembles that of an 1853 pattern Cavalry Trooper Saber, some of which were produced at Enfield. The 1853 pattern Cavalry Trooper Sabers had relatively straight blades, so that they were dual purpose cut and thrust swords. This style of blade remained in use by British cavalry until 1880 and was ultimately replaced by the <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1916-pattern-1908-british-cavalry-saber.html">Pattern 1908</a> straight-bladed saber. One notable feature of the 1853 pattern was that it was the first British military sword to have a full tang, which greatly increased its strength.</p>

<p>The blade of this pulwar does in fact bear what appears to be an Enfield mark in the correct font for a pattern 1853 sword, but this blade was unlikely to have ever been part of a British military sword, either captured or issued. First of all, the blade does not bear any military acceptance ("broad arrow") marks. Additionally, an issued blade of this era would also have had the year stamped along with the Enfield mark. Since Enfield was not an exporter per se, I think that it is reasonable to speculate that this blade was diverted to British India either through some official or clandestine channel. Britain was certainly interested in courting the favor of local leaders both inside and outside of Kabul, which suggests that either the blade or the complete sword was intended as a gift. Of course a complete sword would make the better gift, so the question then is where was the blade assembled with the hilt? The three choices I imagine would be England, British India, or Afghanistan. I doubt if this workmanship, with such a nice rendition of the local style and an Arabic invocation, originated in England, so I would guess either British India, or Afghanistan. I would lean toward the former. The workmanship on the hilt is excellent. The Arabic invocation worked into the knuckle guard translates as "In the name of Allah the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful."</p>

<p>It seems likely that the nicely finished scabbard was also adapted from a British military scabbard. The standard scabbards were steel, and this scabbard appears to have a leather cover glued on top of a rigid core, so that it could easily have been adapted from the original steel scabbard with the drag removed.</p>

<p>A curious, and perhaps significant, fact is that "ENFIELD" is rather poorly struck, so that it looks more like ENFIELT. This might suggest that the mark is fake, added to a native blade to give it the status of British manufacture. However, as suggested by the quote from the Emir Abdur Rahman, a British association might not have been an entirely desirable thing. Additionally, the overall appearance of this sword, with its relatively straight blade, makes it appear quite different from a typical Afghani <a href="1820-afghani-pulwar.html">pulwar</a>, supporting an English association. Could the mark perhaps have been poorly struck on purpose, using a worn or altered stamp? As a concluding speculation, might the somewhat dubious marking been intended to add a certain element of plausible deniability, either for the giver or for the recipient of the sword?</p>
