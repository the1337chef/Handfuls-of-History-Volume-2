<p id="date">Circa 1840</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Persia (modern day Iran) has long been the capstone of the Middle East. The various Persian Empires, going back to the times of Cyrus the great (circa 550 BCE) and his successors Darius and Xerxes, expanded into Afghanistan and Arabia but were famously stopped when they invaded Greece. After being conquered by Alexander, there followed a long succession of dynasties ruling Persia, beginning with the Seleucids, who were of Macedonian origin, followed by the Parthians and the Sasanians, who managed to keep Rome at bay.</p>

<p>The Sasanians, who ruled the region from 224 to around 651 CE created a strong Persian identity that persisted even after the coming of Islam in 651. The Islamization of Persia was a relatively slow process and ultimately there was a reciprocal spread of elements of Persian culture through much of the Islamic word, especially after the expansion of the Persian Seljuq Empire into Turkey, the Levant (Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria) and eastward through Afghanistan and beyond. Persian dynasties were also the first to take Islam into Northern India, initially as forays of conquest and later establishing the powerful Delhi Sultanate.</p>

<p>Persia fell under the path of Mongols conquest in 1219 after the current Persian Khwarezm dynasty incurred the wrath of Genghis Khan by massacring the members of two diplomatic missions sent by the Khan. For 80 years following the death of Genghis Khan, Mongol dynasties ruled Persia, but over those years the ruling Mongols themselves became orientalized. After the Mongol rulers weakened there followed a period of rule by dynasties of Turkic origin, which is to say of the same lineages of peoples who established themselves in Turkey. In 1501 the Safavid dynasty was founded by Ismāil, a moment in time that is associated with the beginning of the modern state of Iran. The Empire of the Safavids was founded with a strong connection to Shia Islam.</p>

<p>The Safavid Empire was one of the three great "gunpowder empires" that stretched from the Ottoman-controlled Balkans to the Mughal Empire in India. The Safavids were squarely in the middle of their two powerful rivals and by time of its demise in 1736, they were also under pressure from the Russian Empire to the north. The Safavid Empire fell in 1722, succumbing to these powerful neighbors.</p>

<p>Mohammad Khan Qajar took control of Iran in 1794, establishing the Qajar dynastic rule. Persian territories in the Caucasus and Central Asia had been shrinking after the fall of Safavid, and the Qajar Emperor recovered some of these lost territories. The Qajar rule represented a consolidation the powers of the numerous Turkic tribes of Iran and there was not a strong central power supported by a large standing army. When the Qajar rulers needed to fight a war, as was frequently the case with their Russian neighbors to the north, they would but out a call to all their subordinate tribal leaders with the expectation that each local sultan would outfit and support his own troops. The greatest factor motivating these irregular troops was the desire and expectation of plunder.</p>

<p>The core of the Qajar armies were mounted troops, and in that era of muzzle-loading firearms, the warriors would sometimes supplement their <a href="1780-shamshir.html">shamshirs</a> and awkward muskets with short throwing spears known as jarids. Weapons of this type were used throughout the Middle East and India from the Middle Ages onward. Often they had wooden shafts and were carried two or more in a quiver that could be attached to the saddle. Georgian Prince Teimuraz Bagrationi, while observing the Qajar irregular cavalry during the first Russian-Iranian war (1804-13), remarked, "this day I saw the splendid cavalry from the nomad tribes coming from Kazvin.... We were shocked by their artful riding, using a lance, rifle, and jarid."</p>

<p>These JARIDS are believed to be of the Persian, Qajar period, mid-19th century. The one which has a pike style blade and a solid shaft is 31 inches long and has sufficient weight that it might have been armor piercing. The second with a trident-shaped blade is 33 inches long and, with a hollow shaft, it is lighter that the spike-like example. Both have a flat tail, presumably to improve their flight when thrown. There are traces of silver Koftgari decoration ion each (more visible on the spike), and the shaft of the trident has a faux-damascus pattern.</p>

<p>Jarids, intended to thrown from horseback, are shorter than a typical javelin, the prototypes for which would have been weapons like the ancient Roman pilum. The Roman pilum had a stout wooden staff as a base, but the spearhead was at the end of a relatively slender steel shaft. The design was such that it was expected that a spear, which hit earth, rather than a flesh and blood target, would end up with a bent shaft. This would render it relatively ineffective for an enemy to pick up and throw back at the legionnaire. Pilums would be recovered after the battle and be suitable for reuse only after being straightened by the company's blacksmith. Jarids, especially ones like these, which originally had decorative silver Koftgari, were intended for reuse. I suppose that since they were designed to be most effective when thrown from horseback with the additional momentum of horse and rider, they might have been less useful if thrown back by a foot soldier.</p>

<p>I wonder about the effectiveness of the sort of "fleur de lis" trident as a weapon. Only the center prong would have much chance of penetration and the outside curves may even be limiting. I can imagine they might have some utility if the weapon was being manipulated but I have less of a sense of how they would be useful on a jarid, which is intended to be thrown.</p>
