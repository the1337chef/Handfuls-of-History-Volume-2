<p id="date">Circa 1780</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The radically curved saber known as a shamshir is one of the most iconic Arab weapons, dating back to the 12th century. The weapon, considered a type of scimitar, is most often associated with Turkey or Persia. It is slashing weapon, probably best suited for use by a lightly armored warrior on horseback. When Europeans first encountered swords of this type during the crusades they were more impressed with the quality of the steel than the configuration of the weapon. The crusader knights were well armored against light cavalry. However, the Europeans were not familiar with the quality of the high-carbon, watered-steel blades we now associate with true Damascus. These blades were made from ingots of <a href="../damascus-steels.html#wootz">wootz</a>, which was primarily produced in India and imported to Arab cities such as Damascus where it was forged into blades. The unsuccessful efforts of European blacksmiths to produce similar steels led to the common, but erroneous, association of pattern welded folded steel with "Damascus."</p>

<p>The Shamshir had a second sort of impact on European militaries when the English and French fought the Ottoman Turks for control of Egypt at the end of the 18th century. Curved cavalry sabers subsequently became popular throughout Europe and in America. Both English and U.S. officers also adopted what became known as Mameluke swords since their hilts were similar to the Arab designs of the Egyptian Mamluks. The dress swords of U.S. Marines are still of this type.</p>

<p>This particular sword is probably Turkish with some later Syrian-Arab modifications and repairs. The blade most likely was made in Persia of low-contrast wootz (true Damascus) steel. It is marked by the maker, not with a typical signature but with some peculiar embossed and inlaid graphic that is hard to interpret.</p>

<p>The armed forces of Ottoman Turkey only began to resemble the armies of the European nation in regards to uniforms and standardized weapons toward the end 18th century. Previously, the armies consisted largely of levies from the various provinces with distinctive local costumes and arms. The Sultan's personal army included the elite infantry known as Janissaries, whose usual sword would have been the <a href="1807-balkan-yataghan.html">Yatagan</a>, and the Royal Sipahis cavalry, who likely would have carried a Shamshir.</p>

<p>The Ottomans fought several wars with Russia during the 18th and early 19th centuries, as well as wars with Austria and Venice. As noted above, they also fought losing battles with France and later England for control of Egypt. By 1830, their empire was in decay as Greece and other Balkan states gained independence. This sword might have been used in any of these conflicts and had a second life with an Arab horseman in the 19th century, during which time the hilt was damaged and repaired.</p>

<p>The marks on the blade must have their own story to tell, and are all the more interesting because they are abstract and figurative rather than simply Arabic script. In general, followers of Islam distain figurative art. Perhaps there is an image of an animal, such as a sheep or a camel in the circle. But whatever it might be, it is sufficiently abstract to inspire Picasso. Perhaps there is stylized script in the second part of the design, but who could say? The clearest image is the small fish that lies outside the main design. There were people of many faiths in the Turkish Empire so perhaps the fish was a small statement by a Christian subject.</p>
