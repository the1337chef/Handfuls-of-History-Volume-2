<p>The first volume of Handfuls of History primarily covered firearms, the history of their development and their impact on the course of human history. This volume is about human artifacts that have an edge and/or a point. Most of them would be classified as weapons but others perhaps might more aptly be characterized as tools. Some are objects that have evolved over time away from being weapons toward being symbols of power, cultural status, or even magic. Some are connected with the mainstream of Western military history, carried along with the pistols, muskets, or rifles covered in Volume 1, especially the bayonets which were introduced alongside the rifles and muskets they were intended to augment. The other main type of item this volume covers are what could be considered “ethnographic,” in that they carry both cultural and historical significance.</p>

<p>The making of stone tools is more ancient than Homo sapiens as a species, and many of the most rudimentary of shaped tools were things that would cut or stab. Granted that not all tools are weapons, but it is hard to imagine that primitive edged or needle-like artifacts would not have been at least sometimes used as weapons for hunting or for prehistoric human conflicts. From stone to bronze to iron, sharp weapons are our most enduring handfuls of history.</p>

<p>Aside from axes and razors, a “blade” usually has both a point and an edge, whereas pikes and needles have a point but not an edge. In the case of a knife, sword, or bayonet, these weapons usually have an edge that will cut and point that will stab (upon a thrust). Historically, specific weapons evolved to be optimized for achieving the most appropriate modes of attack based on several factors. Bayonets effectively turn a rifle or musket into a spear or lance, and these are thrusting “weapons.” In the case of an ordinary knife, the edge is most often more important than the simple tip of the blade. In the case of swords, we can see the entire range of intent, from the rounded tip of the headsman’s sword, to the point of the almost blade-less rapier.</p>

<p>Although they may vary greatly in appearance, nearly all of the items in this volume have an edge or pointed tip of steel. While there is history in the nature and composition of the sorts of steel used, similar steels wrought by different hands, formed into differing shapes, with grips of different materials, will make very different weapons. This book is an exploration into different cultures as much as it is a study of history. The two are inseparable since history is most often made in the confrontations between different cultures.</p>

<p>The artifacts themselves may not be very ancient, but in many cases, they represent the retention of an ancient or historic form unique to a specific people. The scope of the topic is enormous so the sampling in this volume may penetrate to some depth, but will hardly scratch the surface (both puns intended).</p>
