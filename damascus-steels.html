<h2>A Brief Discussion of Iron, Steel, and Patterned Steels</h2>
<h4><i>Dr. Stephen A. Bloom&dagger;</i></h4>

<p>The Bronze Age ended and the Iron Age began approximately 4,000 years ago somewhere in southwest Asia. Iron is common, being the fourth most abundant element on the planet. While metallic iron can be rarely found in the form of iron-nickel meteorites, iron is usually found in an oxidized state as iron ore. The process of reducing the oxide to metallic iron is referred to as smelting–typically done by heating the ore in a reducing or low-oxygen atmosphere. The result is a ductile material superior in performance to copper or bronze. When combined with carbon, steel results. “Mild steel” is iron with low to modest levels of carbon (0.01-0.25 percent), “tool steel” is typically defined as having 0.6-1.2 percent carbon, and “cast iron” contains 2-4.3 percent carbon. As applied to edged weapons, steel is a vastly superior material compared to copper or bronze. It is far stronger and far more capable of holding an edge. The downsides are rust and the sheer difficultly of making and working the material.</p>

<p>Given the primitive methods of smelting ore, the results were typically heterogeneous with regard to carbon content due to the material never achieving a totally molten state. The results were usually a spongy, porous material combined with slag (miscellaneous bits of charcoal, unrefined ore, etc.). This material could be brought to welding temperatures (approximately 2400-2800 degrees Fahrenheit) and hammered to reduce the slag content, to burn away carbon (down to 0.02-0.08 percent levels), and to consolidate the material. Since the resulting material had been worked, it was referred to as “wrought iron.” As the weld and hammer process was repeated, the quality of the material improved (“first refined” was welded once, “second refined” was welded again, etc.). Wrought iron typically contains 1-2 percent silicon (so is therefore more resistive to rust than modern steels) and is composed of fibers of iron rather than isolated crystals of iron/steel.</p>

<p>The production of iron in antiquity was an industrial process and was well established by 500 BCE in Europe. Water wheels (and later steam engines) were employed to power giant bellows and massive power hammers. Forests vanished to supply the charcoal. Wrought iron was the basis of civilization until the Bessemer Conversion Process (1856) and later the Open-Hearth Process allowed an inexpensive method to achieve a fully molten state on an industrial level, thus the Steel Age began (1).</p>

<p>The quality of steel is directly related to the homogeneity of the material. Steel with heterogeneous levels of carbon and slag inclusions will respond differentially to stress as opposed to responding as a unit. When applied to blades, the results are bends, cracks and failures. While the occasional bit of good steel might result from the refining process, steel was normally created by a diffusion technique (cementation) resulting in “blister steel.” Wrought iron bars, charcoal, and potentially other “magic” ingredients were packed together and held in sealed containers at high heat for days. The carbon containing materials would combust, thus reducing the free oxygen in the container. The resulting carbon monoxide would then diffuse into the wrought iron. The result was wrought iron bars with carbon contents approximating 1 percent but the base material was still heterogeneous and diffusion was probably not uniform across the diameter of the bars (2). In Europe in the 1740s, Benjamin Huntsman (an English clockmaker working on making decent clock springs) discovered that blister steel could be melted in a crucible, thus producing a homogeneous material–crucible steel. The result was high quality steel, but at great cost (3).</p>

<h3 id="wootz">Wootz</h3>
<p>Long before 1740, crucible steel was produced, but not in Europe. In India (and perhaps Ceylon and other Asian locations) at or before 500 BCE, high-carbon, homogeneous steel was being produced. The basic process was thought to consist of encapsulating iron ore and appropriate carbon-bearing materials in a sealed ceramic container (essentially a crucible with a sealed lid). The containers were brought to temperature for a significant period of time. The carbon material combusted (just as in blister steel) but at a temperature such that the reduced iron ore became molten. With the right amount of fuel and the right ore to start with, steel comparable to modern steels resulted. This material was traded over the Silk Road to Europe and the Middle East and even reached Viking smiths. In the 19th century, English writers referred to this material as “wootz” but it is better known as Damascus steel. The reason for that nomenclature was that one variant of the steel when carefully processed into weapons developed a patterned surface, and the process was discovered by smiths working in Damascus (4, 5). The process of making and forging this material was re-discovered in the 20th century by Alfred Pendray, and scientifically investigated by J.D.Verhoeven among others. Ric Furrer is another modern smith who has recreated some of these ancient methods. His work has been featured on PBS and videos can be seen on YouTube*.</p>

<p>Patterned steels, however, need not be wootz (see 6 for an overview). The term “Damascus” has been applied to any patterned steels. Blades of wootz are often called “true Damascus” while non-wootz blades are referred to as “patterned-welded Damascus.” Celtic smiths were welding heterogeneous bars of steel to form a banded pattern as early as 500 BCE (7). Initially, layers of steel of varying types were piled upon one another and the stack then welded together. This is basically the technique still in use by modern smiths making pattern-welded blades. The process was used and advanced by Anglo-Saxon and Viking smiths (6th-9th centuries) and there is reasonable evidence that structural as well as appearance benefits accrued from the process (8). The basic concept is to create multiple bars of material, which can have variable compositions and be twisted clockwise or counterclockwise or not twisted. The bars are then welded side-by-side to create potentially mind-blowing patterns. Given the heterogeneity of steel produced in Europe and the existence of wootz, it is likely that some blades were created by forging a core of European steel and then adding wootz edges. There are many other traditions for generating pattern-welded blades, such as the Palomar or Indonesian methods but they are essentially the same as what is described above–some combination of piling and bar formation.</p>

<p>In modern times (1800s and on), patterned steels have been used for shotgun barrels (a ribbon of patterned steel is wrapped around a mandrel and welded). The result is a beautiful barrel that will almost certainly fail if subjected to a modern gunpowder explosion. There are smiths currently who weld a ribbon onto a core of 4140 steel and then drill and rifle the barrel.</p>

<p>Another tradition of patterned steels can be found in Japan. The steel available is tamahagane, a heterogeneous material that emerges from the smelting process in small pieces. The smith sorts the material into high and low carbon categories (by mechanical testing–if it bends, it is low; if it cracks, it is high). Blades require 0.6 percent carbon to harden completely and carbides form if the carbon content exceeds 0.77 percent (see 9 for an in-depth explanation). Given the hand finishing used for the traditional Japanese blade, carbides are not a good idea since files and stones will die fairly rapidly. The goal of the Japanese smith is then to create steel that falls within those limits, typically near 0.63 percent. A pile of steel shards are carefully assembled and welded into a billet (10). As the welding proceeds, the smith assesses carbon content by “feeling” how the steel works on the anvil. If the carbon content is too low and the steel deforms too easily, then high carbon steel must be added for the next weld. Conversely, if the material is too stiff, then low carbon material will be added. Due to the nature of the stock material (shards rather than plates), the resulting pattern resembles wood grain and the number of layers dwarfs that of other pattern-welded steels. The use of this steel in the fabrication of a blade is outside the scope of this essay but 10 gives a decent overview.</p>

<p>The necessity of generating pattern-welded or wootz steel blades has faded with the advent of modern high-carbon steels. The desire to create something of beauty and the desire to appreciate the same has not faded. Modern blade makers continue to expand the envelope of what can be created.</p>
