<p id="date">Circa 1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The stability of a great empire relies on the ability of the Emperor to control their subjects in many far-flung lands. This is especially true if there is to be a dynastic succession. The empire of Alexander the Great shattered into three large pieces upon his death. The dynasty of Alexander's general Ptolemy endured in Egypt for three hundred years by adopting the trappings and boundaries of the ancient Pharaohs. Some empires like those of the Romans, Austro-Hungarians, and Ottoman Turks, controlled distant provinces by entrusting their control to client kings. This worked well enough most of the time, but often required there to be provincial governors, and sometimes a Roman army garrison, to keep the client kings from declaring independence. Worse still, there were cases when the provincial governors took their legions back to Rome to overthrow the Emperor. Of course, since the governors of Roman provinces were usually aristocratic military veterans, this was an inherent risk to the Roman system. This was not so much a risk with the "Mandarin" system that developed in China.</p>

<p>In China it became possible for boys from well-to-do or even middle class families to become educated and participate in a national system of examinations that could qualify them for placement and advancement in the imperial government. This system was the major form of government advancement in China from the 7th century until the end of the Empire 1,300 years later. The exams were offered at several levels as candidate could thus advance through the Imperial bureaucracy, with the highest appointees known as Mandarins by the Portuguese. Although on the surface, the system provided opportunity for many people to advance, it is also criticized for being rigidly conservative in its structure and subject matter, which was mostly Neo-Confucian orthodox philosophy. As China confronted the West, reliance on the old ways of thinking made China inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world.</p>

<p>Hong Xiuquan (birth name Hong Huoxiu) was the third son of a poor family that managed to enroll him in the education system which would qualify him to take the Imperial exams. Although he passed with highest rating on the preliminary local exams, in 1836 he failed the Imperial exams, which had a pass rate of only about one percent. By this time he had become an adamant convert to Christianity. Hong had a mental breakdown after failing the exams a second time the following year, after which he began having dreams and visions. Eventually he came to believe that he was himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ and that it was his mission to redeem China.</p>

<p>Xiuquan took his mission seriously and began preaching and accumulating followers. In 1850, when the number of his followers was between 10 and 30 thousand, the Qing authorities began to be worried, and in 1851 government troops sent to disperse them were routed and the Qing official was killed. This was the beginning of what has come to be known as the Taiping Rebellion. It is often considered the beginnings of the Chinese people's revolution against the Empire.</p>

<p>The popularity of Xiuquan's "Heavenly Kingdom" movement grew, eventually attracting many followers to the curious heterodox Christian cult. In 1859 Hong Rengan, a cousin of Xiuquan, joined the Taiping forces which had established a capital at Nanjing. Under Rengan's leadership the army of the Taiping expanded their territory but also fought failed campaigns to capture Shanghai to the South and Beijing to the North. At its height, the Heavenly kingdom controlled a substantial portion of southeast China with a population of about 30 million people. By the time the rebellion was finally squelched in 1864 more than 20 million people, mostly civilians, had perished.</p>

<p>Early on in his career as a would-be Chinese Messiah, Xiuquan commissioned the forging of two enormous "demon-slaying" swords, said to have blades a meter long (39 inches). No one knows what these swords actually looked like. This particular sword, which is quite large with a blade of about 30 inches, is likely of the period of the Taiping Rebellion. There was no other conflict in China of that era of comparable magnitude.</p>

<p>The Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901 also began with armed civilian aggression, at that time largely directed toward the Europeans attempting to control Qing China. The total number of Boxer insurgents has been estimated at no more than 300 thousand, far less than those who fought for the Heavenly Kingdom. However, it should be noted that among the Boxers were a group known as the "Big Swords Society."</p>

<p>This is a massive sword to swing, actually a bit unwieldy. One picture shows it compared to a more ordinary sized sword, the <a href="../chapter-7/1880-visayan-tenegre.html">Visayan Tenegre</a>. Nonetheless, it might have been a comfort in the hands of a peasant soldier facing Imperial troops, or even worse, well-armed westerners. However, the shape of the blade and the handle suggest that this might have originally been a pole arm, such as a guandao, that was later cut down to be used as a sword. The handle might well be just the remnant of the original staff, especially lacking any sort of pommel. Perhaps the original weapon was damaged and converting it to a sword was just a way to salvage the blade. It might also have been the case that it was a captured weapon that came to someone who was more comfortable using it as a sword.</p>
