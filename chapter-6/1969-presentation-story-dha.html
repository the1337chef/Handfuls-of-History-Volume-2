<p id="date">1969</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This sword belonged to Hugh J. Benn, Jr., who was born November 21, 1918 in Sommerville, Massachusetts, and passed away in Sarasota, Florida, on June 30, 2012*. He enlisted in the Army in 1939 and served through World War II, the Korean War, and during at least part of the Vietnam War, achieving the rank of Chief Warrant Officer Grade 4. Army Warrant Officers are technical experts and not usually combat soldiers. At various times in his Army career, he was stationed in Japan, Germany, Ethiopia, and Burma. This sword tells us that in 1969 he served in the clandestine U.S. "Military Equipment Delivery Team" (MEDT), that provided military aid to the then-current dictator of Burma, Gen. Ne Win.</p>

<p>The MEDT provided various sorts of supplies and equipment "conducted under the guise of a sales program, which allowed Burma to 'purchase,' with token payments in non-convertible local currency, U.S. materiel and services provided through grant aid military assistance. Such an arrangement obviated most of the normal grant aid regulatory requirements, which are distasteful to Burma, and allows the maintenance of her posture of neutrality and nonalignment." As of 1969, the Burma Military Assistance Program had provided approximately $50 million in investment items and $30 million in supporting items, training, and related services.</p>

<p>The report of the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command further states, "Although this is a small program, it is considered very important. While Burma adheres to a strict neutrality, the Military Assistance Program to that country has resulted in authorization for the U.S. Military Equipment Delivery Team to be stationed in Burma. This small group is the only outside military presence allowed in country and is important in terms of maintaining U.S. influence. While Burma's strategic location between India, Thailand and Red China makes it a tempting prize, the Burmese Government has demonstrated its desire for independence by taking an aggressive stand against Chinese Communist-inspired insurgency and provocation. To strengthen this resolve, there is a continuing need for assistance to Burma, the magnitude of which should be continually evaluated."</p>

<p>The MEDT did a reasonably good job of keeping a low profile. However, in 1970 their cover was blown when reports of their existence and activity were published in U.S. newspapers. One report appearing in the Chicago Tribune on August 26, 1970 states: "The MEDT believed to be the only one of its kind, has headquarters in an unmarked villa on the capital's outskirts.... The team, which does not advise the Burmese on the use of the material it delivers, operates quietly but not with total secrecy. Its villa is distinguishable from others only by the 20 cars and pickup trucks in the yard. A taxi driver identified it as "the American ammunitions office.""</p>

<p>The Pacific Commander in Chief's report stated that "a very favorable rapport existed between MEDT personnel and their working level counterparts in the Burma Defense Forces (BDF). Senior Burmese military leaders were attending virtually all of the MEDT social functions to which they were invited." It was also reported that: "Personnel replacements continued to be troublesome to the MEDT. Delays in replacement arrivals due to visa problems had continued. Of the 33 replacements received during the past two years, only four met their predecessors. Since it required about five months to obtain a Burma visa from the CONUS, replacements should be identified at least six months in advance of reporting dates. During the next seven months, four individuals will be rotating for whom replacements had not been identified. Additionally, as proposed a year ago, in view of the environment in which the MEDT must function, the CHMEDT should have the opportunity to accept or reject senior replacement personnel. Also, in recognition of the existing family living conditions, the CHMEDT had instituted a policy of not approving concurrent travel of dependents with incoming replacements when the size of the family exceeded two children."</p>

<p>We know from his obituary that Hugh's wife Marguerite was with him in Rangoon. From Marguerite's obituary, we know that she was a secretary for the government at the American Embassy in Burma, and also that she was affiliated with the Peace Corps when they lived in Ethiopia. Hugh and Marguerite had two children, Hugh Joe Benn III and Linda. Hugh Benn III was born in 1942. I have not had much luck tracing his history, but at age 27 it seems unlikely he would still have been living with his parents when they were in Burma in 1969. I did discover that in 2014 he was living in Palm Bay Florida, and that in January of 2016 his wife sold his house, so he may be deceased.</p>

<p>Perhaps as a consequence of the publicity following the 1970 newspaper stories on the clandestine activities of the Burma Military Equipment Delivery Team, the Burma Military Assistance Program was officially terminated on June 30, 1971 and the last U.S. enlisted man attached to the U.S. Embassy at Rangoon was moved out on December 31, 1971. However, a new Military Equipment Delivery Team was activated in Cambodia in January l971.</p>

<p>I think it is reasonable to assume that this short dha sword was presented to Mr. Benn when he was due to rotate out of his position in the Rangoon MSDT, it was probably a gift from his commanding officer or his colleagues on the team. Perhaps even some of the congenial local Burmese officers were in attendance at a farewell party for Mr. Benn (Mister being the correct form of address for a warrant officer).</p>

<p>This sort of decorative piece is sometimes referred to as a story or temple dha (dah). They may have been inspired by more elaborate and well-crafted earlier swords like the <a href="1878-burmese-dah.html">silver dah</a> in this book. Later swords like this, made in the 20th century, were however, typically of relatively low quality. They may in fact have been intended for sale to Europeans and many were brought to the U.S. by returning veterans. The way in which the silver hilt and scabbard were crafted to have panels suitable for engraving is consistent with this having been made as a trophy item.</p>

<p>The shape of the blade would suggest that it was made in northern Thailand, but script is Burmese. An unusual, and not very effective, technique has been employed to decorate the blade. The surface was scratched and cross hatched. Then it appears that an effort was made to polish letters and images into the roughened surface. The effect is not very striking. It is difficult to bring out the images even by eye, and nearly impossible with photography. The approach in some ways resembles koftgari, a method used to good advantage on the <a href="../chapter-5/1790-tiger-tooth-dagger.html">tiger tooth</a> dagger. With proper koftgari only the spaces to be inlayed with gold or silver are etched, but on this piece the entire surface of the blade might have been prepped but then silver was only applied to limited areas.</p>

<p>*This essay draws on three primary sources; the obituary for Hugh J. Benn Jr., published in the Sarasota Herald Tribune from July 5, 2012, an article published in the Chicago Tribune Aug. 26, 1970, and a declassified report of the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command 1969 (originally defined as top secret).</p>
