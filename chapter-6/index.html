<h1>Chapter 6. China, Tibet, and Southeast Asia</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>	China, the center of Asia, has been known since ancient times as the Middle Kingdom. Is the only ancient Empire to have survived to the 20th century with any sort of real continuity, even though over the span of 2,000 years it was ruled by more than a dozen different dynasties. In some cases, as with the Yuan dynasty found by Mongol descendents of Genghis Khan, the conquerors were themselves overpowered by what it meant to be the emperors of China. Kublai Khan fashioned himself the Emperor of China the same way that the descendents of the Greek general Ptolemy, who ruled Egypt after the conquest of Alexander, fashioned themselves the Pharaohs of Egypt. </p>

<p>	Of course the history of China is far older than the history of the Chinese Empire, which is generally dated as beginning with the rise of the Han dynasty at the end of warring states period (450–220 BCE) (from which the <a href="../chapter-1/-400-bronze-sword.html">bronze sword</a> in Chapter 1 might be associated). Although fraught with periods of turbulence, especially as the empire transitioned from one dynasty to another, the Empire endured until 1912 and was the fulcrum of much of the history of Asia. The monarchies of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam were modeled after that of China. For the first thousand years of the current era, Vietnam was a province of China and even afterwards the Kings of Vietnam looked to the China for approval of their accession to the throne. For almost its entire history, Korea was a tribute state to China, until a Japanese take-over in 1910. </p>

<p>	Tibet, on the high Himalayan plateau, emerged briefly as a powerful empire around the year 800 and made itself known to China first by sending ambassadors to the Imperial court and later by threatening western provinces of China. However, the influence of the Tibetan Empire was brief. Within a hundred years, the Tibetan Empire was fragmented into minor states that were themselves short-lived. It was during this period that Tibetan Buddhism began to take flourish and shape Tibetan culture.</p>

<p>	A unique blend of religion and secular life in Tibet developed after the foundation of the Sakya Monastery in 1073. The growth of this monastery was supported by the Mongols, who had been influenced by Tibetan monks even prior to the Mongol expansion into Tibet in 1240. Although Tibet was absorbed into the Mongol Empire, it was allowed to retain control of its own politics and religious. This autonomy continued under the Mongolian-dominated Yuan dynasty of China, as Kublai Khan was himself converted to Buddhism by Tibetan monks. From the 1400s forward, Tibet was controlled by the monasteries, rather than by secular rulers, although not without contention between the various Buddhist sects. Later Chinese dynasties, for the most part, tolerated Tibetan autonomy but established Imperial residents, known as Ambans, who commanded small garrisons of Chinese troops in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The Chinese forces served as much to defend Tibet from other outside threats as to enforce Chinese control. Qing armies helped defend Tibet from the Dzungars in 1722 and an invasion from Nepal in 1790. </p>

<p>	Tibet did far better than many Asian nations at resisting European imperialist ambitions and was able to maintain a policy of isolationism until the beginning of the 20th  century when both Russia and England made threatening overtures. At that time, the Qing asserted that they were sovereign over Tibet, a concept that the two European powers were willing to accept, if just to keep each other at bay.</p>

<p>	As noted above, China made numerous efforts to expand into Southeast Asia and had some success in Vietnam. At the time though, the nation of the Viet people was restricted to the northern third of the modern nation. China was less successful in the interior of Southeast Asia, where several other influences converged on the tribal peoples as they developed. Hinduism spread from India and shaped the great Khmer Empire that dominated most of Indochina from 800 to 1400. Buddhism was also an important force in the region, involved with the growth of states such as Thailand, which emerged as a strong kingdom only after escaping domination from Burma around 1800. Thailand was in the fortunate position of being in between British expansion into Burma and the French territories in Indochina so that both European powers had a tacit agreement to let Thailand exist as a buffer zone between their separate “colonies.”</p>

<p>	Several ethnic groups became collateral damage to the ambitions of the larger states in Southeast Asia. One such group was the Chams, remnants of the Kingdom of Champa, which existed from the seventh to the 18th century. Based on their language, it is believed that in about the second century the Chams migrated from Borneo into the area that is now the southern part of Vietnam. Initially their culture was, like those of their neighbors, heavily influenced by India. But they later became strongly influenced by Islam, which was becoming established in the South Asian Island nations and the Malay Peninsula. The kings of Vietnam began a program of southern expansion in the 15th century but their conquest of Champa was not complete until the early 1800s. The Cham people were not well treated by the Vietnamese and many immigrated into Cambodia or Muslim Malaysia. Of course, the Vietnamese themselves were shortly later to become the victims of French Imperialism with the takeover of the country beginning in the south in 1862 and finally overcoming the Viet homeland in the north by 1885. </p>

<p>This chapter covers some of these Asian nations and their intermixed histories.</p>
