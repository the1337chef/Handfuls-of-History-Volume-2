<h4 id="dagger">Dagger</h4>
<p id="date">Circa 1906</p>

<div class="text">
<p> At the beginning of the 20th century, the continent of Africa had been largely divided into pieces by the European powers, in the form of colonies and spheres of influence. The Turks had largely lost North Africa to the French and English, with Italy looking for a piece. Countries that established colonies all along the coast were making inroads into the interior. Aside from Ethiopia, the only truly African nation was the short lived Dervish state in Somali (Somali: Dawlada Daraawiish, Arabic: Ø¯ÙÙØ© Ø§ÙØ¯Ø±Ø§ÙÙØ´).</p>

<p>Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, a Sunni religious leader raised an army that between 1901 and 1904 fought a series of success campaigns against Ethiopian, British and Italian forces that allow for his forces, known as the Dervish army, to establish an independent nation in central Somali. The Dervish state was officially recognized by the Triple Entente powers; Germany, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman Turks, who were soon to oppose the allies of World War I.</p>

<p>Hassan, who took the title Sayyid, exploited Britain's need to withdraw from Africa in the face of the approaching European war to consolidate his position, building more than a dozen fortresses and a walled capital city at Taleh. The Dervish state created by Hassan lasted only until 1920 when the British returned to their neglected interests in Africa. With the aid of aerial attacks, the British took Taleh and the Sayyid fled with the remnants of his army. Although they never regained power, Muhammad Abdullah Hassan and other writers and poets of his short-lived era established a literary tradition that created a Somali national identity. Hassan is still considered by many to be the father of modern Somali. His legacy inspired later leaders to resist European hegemony and ultimately establish the modern Somali state.</p>

<p>This dagger, also known as a belawa, is of a style especially associated with the Dervish state. The belawa blade is traditionally leaf shaped but non-symmetrical. The pommels are sometimes three pronged, as on the <a href="1906-somali-billao-dervish-sword.html">Billao sword</a>, or have a single central silver cap as on this example. The blade on this example is 8.5 inches long and the hide scabbard is likely to be the original.</p>
</div>
<br>

<h4 id="short-sword">Short Sword</h4>
<p id="date">Circa 1906</p>

<div class="text">
<p>	Circa 1906: These two weapons are associated with the period in Somali history when there existed for a short time an independent Islamic nation that came to be known as the âDervish State.â The âbillaoâ style daggers and swords have non-symmetrical leaf shape blades and handles most often made of sections of ivory or horn separated by layers of brass. The pommels are normally one of two styles, with a large square block topped by either a single central post, as on the dagger, or with three metal prongs one on each side as well as one in the center, as on the sword. Although most strongly associated with the Dervish state, the significance of that period to the Somali people probably led to the form being continued into the 20th century since they have became national symbols. The Billao weapons also bear a certain resemblance to the <a href="1950-afar-jile-dagger.html">Jile</a> Daggers, used by the nearby Danakil people in the Horn of Africa. The blade of the dagger is 8.5 inches long and that of the sword is 13.5 inches long. Both are of sufficient age to possibly date to the time of the Dervish state. They have their original leather scabbards and the sword also has an original belt.</p>

<p>	As part of the pan-European grab for Africa, in 1884 Great Britain managed to establish control over a portion of Somali and the Horn of Africa as the British Somaliland protectorate. It was located between Ethiopia and an Italian Somali colony on the coast. However, Britain had relatively little interest in the territory and saw it primarily as a source of supplies for their colony of Aden on the Arabian coast and as a station from which they could try to check the still-active African trade in slaves.</p>

<p>	By 1897, British control of the area was threatened by a rising Islamic movement led by Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, who came to be known as the âMad Mullah.â Due to their fervent dedication to their leader his followers became associated with the transcendental Islamic practitioners known as Dervishes. In 1899, enraged at the European inroads into his homeland, Hassan declared Somali an independent nation, with himself the monarch. </p>

<p>	The Dervish state defended itself with a sizeable army of dedicated followers, supported by paramilitary Bedouin volunteers. They built fortresses throughout the Horn of Africa, and established a capital at Taleh that was a large walled town with 14 fortresses. Ethiopia sent an army against the Dervishes in 1900 that, after an initial success, was subsequently defeated by a counter attack of the Ethiopian garrison at Jijiga. The Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II proposed to the British that they join forces with him against the Dervishes but for over 20 years the British tried to capture Hassan and suppress his followers without success. In 1920, following the end of World War I, the British were able to bring to bear fresh forces augmented with new technology, including bomber airplanes, against the Dervish capital of Taleh. The victorious British campaign lasted only a month. With their capital occupied, Hassan and his surviving followers fled to nearby Ogaden in South East Ethiopia. For a time Hassan had some success at rallying his followers and gaining new recruits from the local Ogaden clans. However, in December of 1920, Hassan died of influenza and without his charismatic personal leadership the Dervish movement disintegrated.  In 2009, the Somali government announced plans to try to locate Hassanâs grave and enshrine his remains in the old Dervish castle at Imi. However, the exact gravesite was unknown and, at present, in spite of DNA analyses, no definitive identification of Hassanâs remains has been made. </p>

<p>	Following the defeat of the Dervish forces, control of the country reverted to the British. However, since Somali gained independence in 1960, Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan has become a national hero to the Somali people. His memory and accomplishments have been especially venerated at times when modern military governments have ruled the country. Hassan has also come to be revered as a poet, and much of the national literature in the Somali language comes from the time of the Dervish state. As noted above, the Billao dagger remains an iconic Somali weapon.</p>
