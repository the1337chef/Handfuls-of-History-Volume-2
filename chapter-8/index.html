<h1>Chapter 8. Tribal Africa</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>Migrations, invasions, conquests and colonizations, these are amongst the great landmarks in human history, and prehistory. However, it is not so easy to differentiate these processes, one from another. Often it is simply a question of perspective; one people’s migration is to another an invasion. A second class of equally significant landmarks are seminal discoveries or technical advances; fire, stone tools, bronze tools, the wheel, iron, animal husbandry, agriculture and irrigation, industry. Along with these are the differentiating factors of culture, most notably language and religion. One people of a specific faith, speaking a distinct language, empowered by iron weapons or by using horse-drawn war chariots, invade and conquer another, thus one era of history ends and another begins.</p>

<p>	Current theory maintains that the human race originated in Africa, which was then the source for migrations that ultimately peopled the world. Although our genetic origins are out of Africa, the seeds for our recorded histories came later, after people settled in the various environments that nurtured early civilizations like those in Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China. As waves of diversified human cultures dynamically swept back and forth across Asia and Europe, at some point splashing over into the Americas, the interior of Africa became relatively isolated. </p>

<p>	Northern Africa participated fully in the early tides of history, from the Egyptians, to the Carthaginians, and the early growth of Islam (see <a href="../chapter-4/index.html">Chapter 4</a>) that reached from Africa into Europe through Spain. During these times however, the interior of the African continent was only probed intermittently from the north and the coasts for trade goods and traffic in slaves. As early as the 1200s, Arab traders plied the East coast of Africa, especially through Somalia and Mozambique and as far as Madagascar. Through the Islamic kingdoms of the Sudan, the Arabs also established caravan routes through the Sahara.</p>

<p>	The strongest military states in Africa developed in Sahel, north of the dense African forests that were the domain of the tsetse fly. Although the native population adapted to the tsetse fly, domestic animals, horses in particular, did not do well in the infested regions. This meant that cavalry and mounted warfare was possible for the kingdoms of the <a href="1880-sudanese-kaskara.html">Sudan</a> and western territories of the Berber and <a href="1890-mandinka-sword.html">Manding</a>, but not in the interior domains. Cavalry not only provided military power, it extended the range over which wars could be fought. The use of horses was also expensive, especially since the animals had to be imported from North Africa or Arabia. As in Europe and elsewhere, this promoted the rise of an elite class of mounted warriors, stratifying the societies and requiring the rulers to raise funds to support the expansionist military states. Much of these funds came from the capture and sale of slaves. </p>

<p>	Europeans began exploring and exploiting the Western coast of Africa after the early adventures of the Portuguese, and once they learned how to manage malaria. Through the aggressive neocolonial policies of the 19th century the European powers managed to divide up nearly all of Africa amongst themselves variously as colonies or “protectorates.”</p>

<p>	For as many European “colonies” as were declared in Africa, there was relatively little migration of European peoples into their African territories, aside from South Africa where conflict between the Dutch and English settlers lead to the Boer wars in the late 19th century. Unlike what occurred in North America and parts of South America, the indigenous peoples of Africa were not replaced with the spawn of the European invaders, they were merely made subjects of the Great Powers, presumably for their own good. Although in recent decades the nations of Africa have, to varying degrees, become members of the international body politic, they have not by and large become thoroughly “westernized” as might have been the intent and desire of their former colonial overlords. Many of the people of the African interior hold onto their ethnic identities and some aspects of, or at least memories of, their original tribal cultures. Ancient animosities still trouble many African peoples, compounded now by aggressive Islamic movements, especially in the north.</p>

<p>	We can try to understand the historical basis for the diversity of native African peoples by considering their varying lifestyles in the pre-colonial period. Some like the Tuareg, were pastoral nomads moving with their animals as they search for grazing lands requires, while others were sedentary agriculturalists. As the nomadic people are more likely to be warlike, they sometime exploited their sedentary neighbors as the “Nobel” Tuareg treat the Ikelan, considering them to be their slaves. Other tribes are thought of as “people of the forest,” living as hunter gathers or by subsistence slash and burn agriculture. Of course, these lifestyle classifications may no longer apply for many peoples in modern-day Africa. The world has changed for them, sometimes providing opportunities for life in cities, but also through the diminution and exploitation of their natural resources and environment. In some parts of Africa, ancient enmities still exist between different peoples, with the conflicts between them worsened by the fact that modern weapons have replaced the traditional sorts presented in this book. Radical Islam is also changing the face of some parts Africa. The Africa that was, will never be again.</p>

<p>	The weapons in this chapter are tangible tokens of the tribal diversity and ethnic identity of a relatively small sampling of African peoples. There are thousands of different identifiable African tribes, and probably distinct subgroups within many of those. As in other parts of the world, each different people may identify with a different sort or style of weapon. </p>

<p>	The first delineator of ethnic lineages is language and there are over a thousand native African language groups. An important consequence of the Arab and European interventions in Africa was the introduction of European languages as the language of the colonial governments. This has facilitated the integration of African nations into the modern world. However, as in other parts of the world, the European interventions have left behind facsimiles of nations, defined by borders created by the conflicts and negotiations among the foreign empire builders. It is hard to speculate whether Africa could exist as a mosaic of thousands of nation states based on native tribal divisions. The European interventions of the 19th and 20th centuries created at least sufficient infrastructure to make it feasible for the existing African nations to participate in modern global economies and politics. However, the European tenure in the interior of Africa was relatively brief compared to, for example, India, Indonesia, and the Americas. As mentioned above, this was in part due to the European susceptibility to the diseases of Africa, most notably malaria. Prior to the mid-19th century the death tolls of European expeditions into the interior of Africa were astoundingly high. This was only reversed after the discovery and widespread use of quinine.</p>

<p>	Most of the interior of sub-Saharan Africa was under nominal European control for less than a hundred years, and as the former colonies obtained independence in the 20th century, the new nations have faced many obstacles. Corruption is rife in many of the African governments and resources are limited and often squandered. Additionally, the borders of the new nations, artificially defined by the former European colonies, in many cases put together tribes with great historical animosities, which have led to modern atrocities as one tribe or military dictator took power over the whole nation at the time of independence. Africa is the Balkans many times over.</p>

<p>	This book is about the edged weapons of peoples around the world. Africa gets very little coverage in <i>Handfuls of History Volume 1</i>, which is exclusively about firearms. Nonetheless firearms, especially long guns, did play important roles in the history of Africa, even before the European grab for African colonies in the 19th century. Strong Islamic Empires of the Sudan obtained muskets from trade with the Arab world. These empires had established caravan routes into the northern edges of the African interior to market like those of Timbuktu. Certainly these Arab guns were used for protection and advantage and also as trade goods, often for the acquisition of slaves to be brought back to the markets of North Africa. As the Portuguese navigated around the coast of Africa in the 1500s they discovered large African Kingdoms in what is now present day Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, and the Ivory Coast. The kings of Benin, the Azante, and the Dahomey acquired guns in trade and took their advantage with them to expand into the interior. The results created another source for the slave trade out of Africa. </p>

<p>	The styles of weapons in this book originated in the pre-colonial era when war between the tribes would not have been uncommon. Some of the weapons are old enough to date from that era. Others come from the colonial era when intertribal warfare was discouraged. During this era, weapons were still made in the old styles because they remained important for the cultural identity of various tribes. However, in many cases they gained greatest significance as symbols of rank and status. These phenomena are not unique to Africa. European and American military officers still carry swords as badges of rank (Chapter 2). Likewise, traditional weapons, such as the Indonesian kris, are venerated as familiar heirlooms in countries around the world.</p>
<br>
<h4 id="throwing-knives">The African Throwing knife</h4>

<p>	As in the other chapters, in this journey through Africa we will consider various styles of swords and knives, as well as a few axes. We will also look at several examples of a style of weapon that is largely unique to Africa, the throwing knife. There are examples of different styles of such knives from the <a href="1920-zande-throwing-knife.html">Zande</a>, <a href="1925-matakam-throwing-knife.html">Matakam</a>, <a href="1930-mbanja-throwing-knife.html">Mbanja</a>, and <a href="1800-sara-throwing-knife.html">Sara</a> tribes. These are true throwing knives, although all are subject to debate on the degree in which they were ever used as such. The <a href="1890-kota-bird-head.html">Kota bird head</a>, and <a href="1890-mangbetu-trumbash-axe.html">Mangbetu Trumbash</a> axes, are sometimes suggested to have been throwing knives, but clearly would not have been suitable for throwing and were more likely symbols of status within the respective tribes.</p>

<p>	A typological characterization of throwing knives proposed by E. S. Thomas in 1925 identified 18 major types, with many variations in each class. The throwing knives of the Sara people are of the simplest and probably earliest form. The Sara knives are flat curved iron bars with a single, relatively short, side arm. Like all true throwing knives, they are planar with only a small allowance for a grip of leather or gut on the end. The knives of the <a href="1920-ingessana-throwing-knife.html">Ingessana</a> are elaboration of the <a href="1800-sara-throwing-knife.html">Sara</a> form, the scorpion type has a wide and somewhat figurative head and side arm, while the serpent style, as the name suggests, has a wavy upper blade. Other types are far more elaborate with multiple auxiliary blades of various shapes, sometimes coming off the central stem at odd points, as in the <a href="1920-zande-throwing-knife.html">Zande</a> knife, others show a certain amount of radial symmetry, as in the <a href="1930-mbanja-throwing-knife.html">Mbanja</a> example. </p>

<p>	It is hard to say how effective these knives would be as weapons and how common their use was in tribal warfare. They are not uncommon in present day Africa and are often carried as part of tribal regalia, but it is unlikely that the proud owners of these heirlooms would actually want to throw them. This is not to say that they would not have been used as weapons a hundred years ago or earlier. P. Westerdijk suggests that the most effective way to throw one of these knives would have been side arm, as one might throw to skip a rock. This way would have the advantage of keeping the knife at something near the same height from the ground for the longest distance. It would probably have afforded the best chance to hit a target if used for hunting, but might not have been practical for warriors drawn up in a line of battle. In such a case, the knives might have been thrown overhand en masse to rain down on an opposing army. This could have been terrifying for an advancing line of foot soldiers and really would have brought chaos into a cavalry unit. Of course, to throw overhand effectively would require getting the range right, easy enough I suppose with a certain amount of practice.  </p>

<p>	Warriors often went to battle with a bundle of three or four knives that could be thrown in succession. The Sara carried their simple knives resting on their shoulders; others with knives of more complex form would carry them hooked on the backside of their shields. Knives with complex radial shapes tended to tumble when they hit a flat surface so that when they struck an ordinary shield held at an angle to protect from a blow from above, some types of knives would have had a tendency to roll right around to the backside of the shield, striking the bearer in the face. Tribes needing to defend against this would use shields with a concave surface to deflect the knives away.</p>

<p>	In addition to whatever usefulness these items might have had as weapons, they were, and to some degree still are, commonly used as “currency.” Although the art of smelting iron has existed in Africa for at least a thousand years, iron was a scarce commodity prior to the ready availability of scrap metal in the 20th century. In central Africa, blacksmiths often had high places in society, and tribes like the Kuba, were said to be ruled by “blacksmith kings.” For some tribes the throwing knives were all the property of the king and following a battle, the king expected to have them returned to him, as they represented a significant portion of his treasury. For other tribes, these items were important for the exchange of wealth between families, so that a bride price might be so many goats and so many throwing knives. For some tribes, throwing knife design devolved so that the items had no realistic value as weapons. Such “knives” lacked effective cutting edges or handles useful for throwing, and often were even made of copper, and thus were only useful as currency. </p>

<p>	This chapter has presented several challenges. Note that it does not include weapons from North Africa, as these seemed more appropriate to include in Chapter 4. Until I started working on this book I had not heard of most of the peoples whose weapons are represented, and researching them has been difficult. I have read several books on Africa and its people, but for the most part the books available only scratch the surface. A book like Return To Laughter by Elenore Smith, for example, which is written about the author’s experience with the Tiv people, provides the only a meager snapshot of a single village over a period of a few years. Textbooks on Africa become terribly dated, as the economic and political situations change almost before they are published. There is very little known about the tribal history of most of the peoples and what is known usually goes back no further than the time of the first European interventions. I confess that I have had to rely more on internet sources for this chapter than I have for other parts of this book, but even Wikipedia has little to offer. My friend Rodney Stubina, who has spent much of his life in Africa, mostly with the Peace Corps, has been a great help in regards to the West Coast and Central African countries, and I am grateful for his insights. Finally, I have to acknowledge that in regards to dating the weapons in this chapter, in many cases I am just guessing, based on their condition and rough understanding of the tribal histories.</p>
