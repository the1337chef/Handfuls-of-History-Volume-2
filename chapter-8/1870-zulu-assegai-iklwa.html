<p id="date">Circa 1870</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The people who came to be known as the Zulu were among the Bantu tribes that migrated into southern Africa around 900 CE. By the time that the Dutch, and later the English, began to colonize the region, the tribes had organized themselves into a strong confederacy known as the Mthethwa Paramountcy. The Zulus emerged as the dominant tribe in this group in the early 19th century after Shaka Zulu, the illegitimate son of the Zulu king, Senzangakona, became a leader of the Mthethwa armies under then king Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo was killed in battle with the Ndwandwe (Nxumalo) nation and with the disruption of the Mthethwa forces that followed the death of Dingiswayo, Shaka reorganized the forces and ultimately took control of what became a Zulu army. By 1825 Shaka's armies had conquered other neighboring tribes, establishing an empire of approximately 11,500 square miles.</p>

<p>Shaka was a charismatic and effective leader, however his behavior became very erratic and dangerous after his mother died in 1827. He demanded that the entire kingdom share his mourning, commanding that no crops be planted and ruling that any woman who became pregnant should be killed, along with her husband. Even the animals were to suffer, and cows were slaughtered so that the calves would share his grief. Cows were a great index of wealth among the Zulu. Not too surprisingly, in 1827 Shaka was assassinated by his half brothers Dingane and Mhlangana. Dingane ultimately became the Zulu king.</p>

<p>Shaka is credited with numerous military innovations, some tactical and others associated with redesign of traditional weapons. Although the term, assegai has come to be mainly associated the Zulu, in fact it refers to the throwing spears that were used by many African peoples. Iklwa is the correct name for this type of shorter thrusting spear used by the Zulu and attributed to Shaka. The name is said to be the sound heard when the weapon was removed from the body of an enemy. A Zulu warrior would normally go to battle with two assegais and an iklwa held behind their shield. They would also carry a wooden knobkerrie club that could be used with great effect at close quarters.</p>

<p>The Zulus lived outside of the tsetse fly zone so that, as noted above, they were able to keep cattle, which were a major measure of wealth. However, they were not known to raise horses and therefore did not practice mounted warfare. The Zulu armies traveled on foot and, in fact, usually went barefooted, although Shaka was reported to have had leather sandals made for himself.</p>

<p>In the decades following Shaka's death, the Zulus became increasingly threatened by the expansion of the British colonies, both directly by the British colony of Natal at the edge of the Zulu kingdom, and indirectly, as the British also displaced Dutch colonists and these Voortrekkers began to impinge on Zulu territory. The discovery of diamonds in 1867 fueled the drive for increased British settlement and control of South Africa. Inspired by their successful federation of the native peoples, French, and English colonists in the Canadian territories, the British attempted the same strategy in South Africa. This led first to a war with the Zulus and later to the two Boer Wars.</p>

<p>In 1879 the British High Commissioner Henry Bartle Frere issued an ultimatum to the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, demanding that he disarm and disband his sizable army. Cetshwayo ignored the ultimatum and Frere sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand. The superior weapons of the British contributed no doubt to a foolish level of over-confidence and the main force of the British columns advanced on the Zulu capital without preparing defensive encampments. The Zulu however, who largely distained the use of firearms as cowardly, were masters of close quarters combat. Using the weapons and tactics developed during the reign of Shaka, they overwhelmed the British in the Battle of Isandlwana. Although it was Cetshwayo's command that his armies not take the fighting beyond the borders of the Zulu kingdom, enthused by their victory at Isandlwana, Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande led a force of between three and four thousand Zulus against the missionary station at Rorke's Drift, which had been converted into a military hospital. The station was located where there was a ford (drift) on the Buffalo (Mzinyathi) River where the British had begun work on a bridge. Word of the massacre at Isandlwana reached the two junior officers commanding the station, Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead, in time for them to put up makeshift fortifications, consisting in some spots of nothing more than bags of meal and biscuit crates. However, under these conditions, thin lines of men, including the "walking wounded" of the hospital, armed with accurate breech-loading Martini-Henry rifles proved their worth against the Zulus, who for the most part were armed with spears and clubs. At least 350 Zulus died in the attacks that were carried on over the course of thirteen hours. British casualties were 17 killed and 15 wounded. On the rare occasions when the Zulu were able to reach the British defenses they were confronted with bayonet-mounted rifles that had a greater reach than the Zulu spears. The tactics of Shaka failed the Zulu at Rorke's Drift on January 23, 1879. Interestingly, among the British causalities is has been estimated that perhaps as much as a quarter of them were inflicted by the few antiquated muskets and rifles that were scattered among the attacking Zulus.</p>

<p>The British subsequently launched a second invasion of Zululand, and having learned from the disaster of Isandlwana, they never failed to make proper defendable encampments. The two forces met in strength on July 4, 1879. Cetshwayo's forces were defeated and the Zulus king became a fugitive. The British annexed Zulu land, divided the realm among 13 subordinate chiefs, and appointed a British Resident to manage their communications with the colonial government.</p>

<p>Today many Zulu people still reside in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, much of which is made up of wild life preserves. Tourism is a major source of income for the area.</p>
