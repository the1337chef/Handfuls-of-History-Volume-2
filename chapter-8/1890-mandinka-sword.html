<p id="date">Circa 1890</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Mandinka people are variously known as the Mali, Mandinga, Mandingos, Manding, or Malinka. They, in fact, constitute numerous subgroups, each with a family of hereditary rulers. The most famous of these were the Kangaba who ruled the Mali Empire, which was founded in the 7th century and became one of the most powerful of the native West African states.</p>

<p>The Mandinka of Mali were in the middle of a profitable trade between the Arab world and the interior of Africa. Gold, ivory, salt, and slaves were key commodities for this trade, and the city of Timbuktu became a major center of culture and wealth. However, by the 15th century the Mali Empire was splintering and in the 19th century they were overwhelmed by a jihad of the Fulani people. Prior to that time, the majority of the Mandinka were animists. Today the vast majority of the Mandinka are ostensibly Islamic, although tribal traditions are still important in the largely illiterate rural communities.</p>

<p>As the Mandinka states grew weak they themselves became targets for slave raids from the Dyula tribes on the coast, who sold their captives to the Portuguese. It was also during this time that intertribal warfare became more common, further weakening the communities and increasing their vulnerability to slaver raids. In some areas, as much as a third of the Mandinka peoples were sold off to the slavers. A large percentage of African Americans are of Mandingo decent, including the family described by Alex Haley in the book Roots.</p>

<p>Today the Mandinka are spread through many West African nations, including the Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, and Mauritania. However, only in the Gambia do they constitute the largest ethnic group (42 percent of the total population). Throughout their history, the Mandinka have primarily been sedentary agriculturalists, living in relatively stable communities. Today peanuts are one of the crops most commonly cultivated by the Mandinka. Although they were city builders of a sort in the heyday of the Mali Empire (building houses of chalk or adobe and covered with thatch), traditional Mandinga now live in small villages. The Mandinka have enduring oral traditions passed from one generation to the next through songs sung to music of the Kora, a guitar-like instrument with 21 strings.</p>

<p>The Mandinka accept polygamy, a man being permitted up to four wives, as long as he can support them all. The Mandinka have traditional rites of passage, which involve ritual cutting of the genitalia. Groups of young men or women pass this rite together and then live outside the village for at least the period of time required for healing.</p>

<p>The glory days of the Mandinka were prior to the 18th century and today, as noted above, they are spread through many modern African nations. This sword is very recognizable as a Mandinka saber. As with many surviving examples, it has what appears to be a European saber blade, probably of French origin. It likely dates to the colonial period of the 19th century. Certain aspects of the form, such as the decorative elements and the spatulated scabbard, may have transferred from other, possibly earlier, styles of weapons. The scabbard has a certain resemblance to that of the <a href="1880-sudanese-kaskara.html">kaskara</a>, although the blade and hilts are quite different. Consistent with their origins, the curved blades of these sabers are suggestive of cavalry swords, but I do not think that the Mandinka had a reputation for mounted warfare, unlike the neighboring Tuareg who use the straight-bladed <a href="1920-tuareg-weapons.html#takouba">Takouba</a>. The grip style, lacking any sort of real cross guard, is reminiscent of a style of Arab Saif known as the <a href="../chapter-4/1910-omani-kattara-sword.html">kattara</a>.  The kattara is mostly associated with Oman and its colony of Zanzibar. Zanzibar was a base for much of the trade from the Middle East into Africa and so the Mandinka of the Mali Empire might have been familiar with the kattara style of sword. However, this connection must be considered highly speculative.</p>

<p>It seems curious to me that this rather stereotyped sword does not have a name of its own, but is rather always just identified as a Mandinka saber. Perhaps it could be considered a Mandinka kattara, however with a European saber blade and Sudanese-style scabbard it is more appropriate to accept it as something unique to the Mandinka.</p>

<p>Some African swords continue to be made in traditional forms because they remain badges of manhood or tribal identity. However, I think the origin of this sword probably predates the birth of the modern African nations and probably to the early colonial era. Between 1891 and 1898 Mandinka fought a war against the French, opposing their colonial expansion. This sword may be from that era or slightly older.</p>

<p>While the majority of Mandinka still live in small rural communities, preserving a semblance of their traditional lifestyle, many have assimilated themselves into modern post-colonial Africa, and in many states national rulers, sports figures, and entertainers have been of Mandingo decent. I do not know how far these men and women of modern Africa go to either embrace or distance themselves from symbols of their tribal origin. For some African Americans connections to their native heritage have been very important. The American actor and celebrity, Lawrence Tureaud, A.K.A., Mister T, has claimed that his trademark hairstyle is based on that of traditional African Mandinka warriors illustrated in a 1977 issue of National Geographic magazine. However, I purchased digital access to the National Geographic archives and there were no articles on the Mandinka, or any other African tribe in 1977. There was an article about the Mandinka and the rubber trade published 20 years earlier but nothing to substantiate an African origin to Mister T's Mohawk.</p>
