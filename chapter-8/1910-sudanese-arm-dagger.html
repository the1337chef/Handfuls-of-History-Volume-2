<p id="date">Circa 1910</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Prior to the succession of South Sudan in 2011, Sudan, located south of Egypt, was the largest nation in Africa. It was home to several ancient civilizations, including the biblical kingdom of Kush. In 1820 it was invaded and conquered by the Khedive (provincial ruler) of Egypt. Although Egypt was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, the Khedive ruled Egypt as an essentially independent domain supported by his own army of <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1944-marine-officers-mameluke-sword.html">Mamluk</a> slave/soldiers. However, the situation in Egypt was complicated by European interests in the country. There had been an invasion of Egypt by the French forces of Napoleon I in 1798, which brought the British in to displace them. Later, after the Khedivate of Egypt was officially recognized as autonomous state, the Europeans returned, looking for new opportunities. The Suez Canal was built in partnership with the French, and completed in 1869. However, the British realized how important the canal would be for their colonies in India and the rest of Asia, so they sent an occupying army in 1882 and from henceforth Egypt came under the British influence.</p>

<p>During the 1870s, a fundamentalist Islamic movement grew in the Sudan, under by charismatic leader, Muhammad Ahmad ibn Abd Allah, known as the Mahdi (Guided One). The Mahdist forces imposed traditional Sharia Islamic laws and offered citizens in conquered villages the choice of accepting Islam or death. It took until 1890, when, with British help, the Khedivate of Egypt was able to reestablish control of Sudan.</p>

<p>In World War II, the Sudan was the site of some of the North African campaigns between the English and the Italians who had occupied Ethiopia. Following the war, the Sudan remained a British protectorate, connected to Egypt until shortly after Egypt achieved independence in 1952. The newly independent Sudan of 1956 was an impoverished nation and there were subsequently several civil wars and military dictatorships. Fighting among rival factions continues to the present day.</p>

<p>The arm dagger is a traditional weapon going back to tribal cultures in the Sudan. Arm daggers are also sometimes worn by <a href="1920-tuareg-weapons.html">Tuareg</a>, but their <a href="1920-tuareg-weapons.html#telek">telek</a> daggers, are of a different style. This is of the distinctive Sudanese style, and as a national weapon, similar daggers are still seen among the forces fighting in the Sudan today. However, they are more likely to be seen in the kit bag for an AK47 than worn on the arm (pictures on <a href="http://www.vikingsword.com/vb/showthread.php?t=15858">Ethnographic Arms & Armour Forum</a>).</p>

<p>This example has a double-edge blade with central ridge and an unusual double arm loop. There is a brass disk on the pommel stamped, "R. DITMAR VIENNA MADE IN AUSTRIA." This was originally the knob for adjusting the height of the wick on an oil lamp. Karl Rudolf Ditmar (1818-1895) invented a lamp adjustment system in 1850 and his products were sold worldwide by the 1860s. After Rudolf died, the company name was changed, so at least this brass token can be confirmed to come from a lamp made prior to 1910 and most likely in the late 1800s.</p>
