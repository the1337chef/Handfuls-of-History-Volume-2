<div class="text">
<p> The Maasai inhabit southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Many traditional villages are near the large game parks of the African great lakes region outside the zone where tsetse flies thrive, so it is possible for the Maasai to raise cattle. The raising of cattle is, in fact, a key defining element of their culture and survival. The cattle are used for milk, occasionally for meat, and also sometimes bled and the blood mixed with the milk, consumed for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<p>The number of cattle in his herd measures a man's wealth and as a semi-nomadic people this wealth supersedes the ownership of land. A respectable herd for a prosperous Maasai would consist of about fifty head. The man would also hope to have many children and probably more than one wife. While polygamy is accepted, it is also a curious Maasai custom that the women are in a sense "married" to all of the men of their husband's age-group. A male guest to a Maasai home was traditionally offered a bed with one of the wives, although it was at the woman's discretion whether she took him as a lover. If she did and became pregnant, the child was simply accepted as one of her husband's.</p>

<p>The Maasai were once famous as warriors and cattle thieves, for it is their belief that all cattle should belong to them. Treaties between the Maasai and the ruling British in 1904 and 1911 restricted the Maasai lands, and these were further reduced in the 1940s when the wild life parks were established. The Maasai however, still demand grazing rights within some areas of the parks.</p>

<p>The Maasai religion is monotheistic, although their god has dual characters that can manifest as either benevolent or vengeful. For the Maasai, life ends without ceremony, as the bodies of the dead are simply left out for scavengers. Corpses are sometimes even dressed with fat and the blood of slaughtered cattle to make them more attractive to the scavenger animals.</p>

<p>As the Maasai come of age, they partake in group-initiations as age-groups, usually between the ages of 12-25. The rituals include circumcisions performed without anesthetics. Traditionally women went through similar rituals but female "circumcision" has been made illegal in Kenya and Tanzania and efforts are being made to replace the practice with a "cutting with words" ceremony involving singing and dancing. However, the traditional practices are deeply engrained and many Maasai men will not accept an intact woman as a wife.</p>

<p>A person from outside the tribe, frequently from a Dorobo group, usually performs the circumcision ceremonies. Blacksmiths known as il-kunon, who also are of other tribes, make the instruments for these purposes, as well as the blades used for the Maasai weapons. Historically, a spear was the principle weapon of a Maasai warrior and the traditional side arm of the Maasai remains the seme sword.</p>

<p>This seme is a classic example of the type. It is 20 inches long, with well-forged blade with a strong central rib widening to 2.5 inches toward the tip in an almost spatulate shape. The handle is hide-covered. Although clearly not a piercing blade, the Maasai would find it useful for many purposes from cutting vegetation to butchering cattle or other game.</p>
