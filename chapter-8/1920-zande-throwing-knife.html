<p id="date">Circa 1920</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Zande (also <a href="1920-azande-sword.html">Azande</a>) are an ethnically mixed Sudanese people living primarily in the Central African Republic, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They live mostly on the shores of the Ubangi River. They are associated with a style of throwing knife known as a kpinga. It is considered one of the most ballistically superior weapons of the northern tribes. It is multi-bladed with roughly radial symmetry. This example is 16.5 inches in length and 14 inches wide.</p>

<p>The Zande practice rudimentary agriculture but the tsetse fly has made the keeping of cattle impractical. Therefore, much of their food is obtained through the traditional methods of the hunter-gather, although they do have domesticated dogs and chickens. Water sources are important for their livelihood and so they identify local geography, including their villages and birthplaces, by the names of the closest streams.</p>

<p>Azande is the name they call themselves while others shorten it to Zande. They are also sometimes referred to by the pejorative name of Niam-Niam, which may be Dinka for "great eaters." Some Western anthropologists have theorized that this term was in reference to a history of cannibalism. The Zande see the world controlled by witchcraft. Although they believed in an all-powerful supreme being, Mbori, their concept of Mbori was more of ghostly spirit to be feared, than a divine spirit to be worshiped.</p>

<p>Their society is patrilineal and each village has a chief or king who rules locally. Polygamy is common and a strong king may have many wives. The basic Zande home is an impermanent structure of wood, mud, and thatch. A polygamous man must provide a house for each wife. The houses of a village are built around a central courtyard that is the center for village social life. Villages are distributed at sufficient distance from others so that each should have sufficient resources to draw upon when times are good. However, when times are poor, war would arise between neighbors. The Zande waged war both on small scale as raids (basapu), and large formal campaigns (sungussungu vura). Their weapons included throwing knives and spears and <a href="1915-ngombe-weapons.html#sickle-sword">sickle-like</a> swords. Of course, in modern times firearms were also used, but often rather ineffectually, fired from long distance until ammunition ran out. While raiding might have occurred between neighboring villages, I imagine that campaigns would have involved allied villages against other tribes.</p>

<p>Zande warriors were known to practice pederasty, older warriors taking younger men as lovers and squires. The Zande fell under the sphere of British colonial "protection" and the British made efforts to discourage tribal warfare and the pederasty of the warriors. The British also attempted resettlement programs, moving people into larger communities and trying to encourage a cash-crop economy based on cotton. The program was ultimately a failure and has not been pursued by the new African nations among whom the Zande people have been spilt.</p>

<p>Although the end of European colonialism left the Zande people split among three different nations, it may be noted that they never functioned as a cohesive tribal force with a single unifying king or spirit of nationhood. The largest population of Zande (730,000 of a total of approximately 1 million in the three nations) is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where they are only one of more than 200 tribal groups and they account for only about one percent of the total population.</p>
