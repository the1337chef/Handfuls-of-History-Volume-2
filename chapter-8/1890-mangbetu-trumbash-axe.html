<p id="date">Circa 1890</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Mangbetu are a large tribe in Central Africa and were a strong well-established kingdom at the time when Europeans first encountered them in the mid-19th century. They had a reputation for being cannibals.</p>

<p>Historically, people of the Mangbetu tribe were readily recognizable because of their elongated heads. Tight wrappings were applied to the heads of babies to distort the skull into a form that achieved the tribe's ideal of beauty. The hairstyles of Mangbetu women often accentuated the elongated skull by creating a disk-like plait of hair at the back of the head. The practice of skull elongation, Lipombo, only began dying out in the 1950s, as the tribal people had more contact with outside cultures.</p>

<p>The Mangbetu are primarily agriculturalists, practicing the rudimentary slash and burn type of farming, and supplementing their diet with the products of hunting, fishing, and gathering. Their art and music however, was considered highly developed, and, of course, representations of Mangbetu people in art are easily identifiable due to their artificially elongated heads.</p>

<p>Mangbetu villages varied in size, so that the village of the king was comparatively large and featured a great hall that could accommodate several hundred people for festivals or ceremonies. Mangbetu village houses were round with high thatched roofs and wooded walls, often decorated with painted murals.</p>

<p>At the time that Europeans first encountered the Mangbetu they had not been reached by either Muslim or Christian faiths. The Mangbetu believed in a creator god known as Kilima or Noro, as well as other gods that might take the form of animals. They believed that the spirits of their ancestors, especially those of former kings, had to be venerated to prevent harm from angry spirits.</p>

<p>It is thought that the distinctive Mangbetu trumbash axe was at one time a weapon of war that also served as an agricultural tool. By the start of the 20th century they became symbolic of the status and authority of the tribal chiefs. However, by the mid-20th century, it seemed that trumbash axes were being made in far larger numbers than would have been required for tribal purposes, suggesting that they were also being produced for sale to "those who travel." On the authority of specialized collectors, this appears to be an authentic old example and not a tourist item.</p>

<p>The trumbash is an odd sort of weapon, a bit uncomfortable to hold and poorly balanced. With a very large and heavy pommel, you might imagine that it could just be set down and it would be stable, but the eccentric blade puts it out of balance. Portraits of Mangbetu kings often show them holding a trumbash as if it were a scepter. Virtually all trumbash axes have one or more holes drilled through the blade. I have only seen a picture of one trumbash that had no holes drilled, most have two holes, but three or four are not uncommon, and some have as many as seven holes. By some reports, the numbers of holes indicated the owner's number of wives. Arguably better sources suggest that the holes were intended to emulate the copper plugs found on ceremonial axes that were indicative of rank within the tribe. Some trumbash axes have pegs protruding on the side, however I have not seen examples that had anything in the holes on the blade.</p>
