<p id="date">Circa 1860</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Abyssinia is a historical name for Ethiopia, and the Abyssinian Empire was one of the most ancient and enduring in history. The Emperors of the Solomonic Dynasty who came to power in about 1270, claimed to trace their lineage back to the biblical Queen of Sheba. Although historians tend to think that Sheba was in southern Arabia, the Ethiopians claim the queen for themselves. Their legends state that the queen was pregnant by King Solomon when she returned from her visit to Jerusalem (circa 940 BCE) and that their son, Menelik I, became ruler of the ancient empire. As a young man, Menelik returned to Jerusalem with a token of his paternity in the form of a ring that Solomon had given his mother. Solomon sent Menelik back to Ethiopia with a retinue of the first-born sons of many noble Jewish families, establishing historical and genetic links between Israel and Ethiopia. Ethiopia was also the first nation in the world to embrace Christianity, as early as the first century. It was the only Christian nation in Africa prior to the colonial era. The Christian (Coptic) communities in southern Egypt recognize the head of the Ethiopian church as their Patriarch. I first heard the Ethiopian stories of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba when I visited the Ethiopian chapel on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The story is depicted there in paintings, and the monks will relate the details.</p>

<p>As with any ancient Empire, there were bumps in the road for the Abyssinians, including a 14-year period, beginning in 1529 when they were occupied by Arab forces from the Adal Sultanate in Somalia, who were aligned with the Ottomans. In 1543 the Ethiopians were able to defeat the forces of Adal with help from the Portuguese navy. Asnaf Sagad I of the Solomonic Dynasty was installed as Emperor, his father, Dawit II, having died in battle during the occupation. Members of the Solomonic Dynasty continued to rule Ethiopia until 1974, when the last Emperor, Haile Selassie, was deposed by military junta. Ethiopia became a multiparty democracy in 1991.</p>

<p>Ethiopia was largely ignored by the European powers until the last half of the 19th century. However in the 1860s the Emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) was beset by internal rebellions and made the ill-considered decision to reach out to the European rulers for aid. Other kings that made the same mistake, and were ultimately successful against their neighbors, found that their new allies were subsequently impossible to get rid of. This was a tale told many times in British India. However, when Tewodros failed to get the requested aid he compounded his mistake by trying to put pressure on the British by mistreating British citizens and taking some, along with British missionaries, as hostages. This prompted a punitive expedition to Ethiopia, lead by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier. It was a challenging campaign for the British, but a remarkable success, with only 20 British casualties (2 dead and 18 wounded) against 2100 Ethiopian (700 dead 1,400 wounded). Tewodros committed suicide.  The British however, loaded with plunder withdrew in good order to distribute their loot among private collections, museums, and libraries in Britain. Amongst their treasures was the crown of Tewodros II. The crown was eventually restored by King George V who personally presented it to the future Emperor Haile Selassie, when the African prince visited England in 1925.</p>

<p>Several European powers made grabs for "colonies" in Africa during the 1880s. Italy, a relatively new country, believed it saw its opportunity in Ethiopia. They first achieved success in neighboring Eritrea in 1889. Eritrea had formerly been the semi-autonomous Kingdom of Aksum attached to the Ethiopian Empire. Encouraged by their success in Eritrea, Italy attempted a conquest of the rest of Ethiopia. What followed was the first Italo-Ethiopian war (1895-1896). The current emperor at the time, Menelik II however, having learned from the mistakes of his predecessor Tewodros, had a well-prepared and more modernized army. The Italians were soundly defeated and withdrew. They abandoned, at least for the time being, any claims on Ethiopia, although they retained control of Eritrea.</p>

<p>In 1935, the Italian Fascists decided to test their new war machine in a second invasion of Ethiopia. This Second Italo-Ethiopian War ended with an Italian victory, although the use of poison gases and other atrocities led to the action being condemned by the League of Nations. The Italian occupation was relatively short lived however, as by January 1941, as part of their African campaigns, the British invaded, and with the help of Ethiopian partisans were able to expel the Italians in November 1941. Haile Selassie was then restored to the Ethiopian throne.</p>

<p>The shotel is a weapon associated with Abyssinia throughout the entire era of the Solomonic rulers. The shotel swordsmen, known as Shotelai, were elite forces, wielding these unusual sickle-shaped swords that reputedly could reach around the shield of an opposing warrior to penetrate vital organs. This is an authentic example with a typical form-fitting leather scabbard and a plan wooden handle, the shape of which allowed it to be held securely. It likely dates to the period of Tewodros II. By the 20th century the shotel was replaced for the imperial guard with <a href="../chapter-4/1870-arab-saif.html">saifs</a>, a term usually applied to scimitar-like Middle Eastern swords. Ethiopian <a href="1930-ethiopian-saif.html">saifs</a> however, were more in the style of European broadswords. Also, in the 19th century a more European type of saber, the <a href="1870-ethiopian-gurade-saber.html">gurade</a> was introduced, taking the place of shotel with mounted troops.</p>
