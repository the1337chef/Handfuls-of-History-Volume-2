<p id="date">Circa 1925</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This piece is representative of the many complex styles of "<a href="index.html#throwing-knives">throwing knives</a>" made by a group of tribes collectively know as the "Kirdi." Kirdi is a word used by the Muslim Kanuri people and translates as "pagan" in English. It was meant as a pejorative to signifying that they were people who have not converted to Islam. There are perhaps as many as forty different tribes who might have been referred to as Kirdi, including the Bata, Fali, Fata, Gemjek, Guidar, Giziga, Hurza, Kapsiki, Mada, Mafa, Massa, Matakam, Mofou, Mora, Mousgoum, Muyang, Ouldeme, Podoko, Toupouri, Vame, and Zulgo. Each of the Kirdi tribes speaks a distinct dialect of the Chadic or Adamawa language. It is reported that most of Kirdi believe in a single creator god, but pray to their ancestors to mediate for them to an unapproachable god. This particular style of knife is from the Matakam tribe.</p>

<p>While the "<a href="1890-kota-bird-head.html">bird's head</a>" throwing knives of the Fang and Koto stand out as readily identifiable, those of the Kirdi most often have complex irregular shapes that seem to defy classification. Additionally, many tribes outside those usually associated with the Kirdi group also use "throwing knives," of different shapes and styles. Other tribes associated with the outstanding variety of items for sale or archived at Oriental arms include the Banda, Funj, Gbaya, Gbaya, <a href="1920-ingessana-throwing-knife.html">Ingessana</a>, Kreish, Laka, <a href="1930-mbanja-throwing-knife.html">Ngbaka</a>, Nzakara, <a href="1800-sara-throwing-knife.html">Sara</a>, and <a href="1920-zande-throwing-knife.html">Zande</a>.</p>

<p>It is hard to say if these were really weapons that could be thrown with any accuracy. If they were thrown in battle and missed their intended targets, it seems there would be the danger of having them just thrown back in return. Throwing knives like this though, have traditionally had another sort of value, they served as a type of currency. In Anthony Tirri's book on African weapons, Tirri especially associates this style of knife with use as currency. Likewise, my friend Rodney Stubina, who was visiting from his work in Chad when I acquired this knife, immediately identified it as currency. Certainly in the present day, its more enduring value may be as a unit of exchange, rather than as a weapon.</p>

<p>The Matakam people, also known as the Mafa, are a mountain people living primarily in northern Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. The name "Matakam" as been translated as "the naked people" and was a name given to them by the neighboring Fulani. In 1999 it was estimated that there were between 82,000 and 150,000 Mafa with a population density 100-140 per square kilometer. They live in small villages with houses of mud brick walls and thatched conical roofs known as sares. They are corn farmers and water is a key cultural resource. Although Christian missionaries have made inroads in some Mafa communities they are still largely "Kirdi."</p>
