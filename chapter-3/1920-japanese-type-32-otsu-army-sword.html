<p id="date">Circa 1920</p>

<div class="text">
<p>Japan introduced a new army sword in 1899. It was called the Type 32 because it was the 32nd year of the Meiji era. The first series (ko) were 39.5 inches long and intended for Cavalry, the second series (otsu) were shorter by 7 inches and were intended for non-commissioned officers and military police. The cavalry versions were never officially withdrawn, and were used by mounted soldiers up to the end of World War II, while the otsu models were replaced new style <a href="1941-nco-shin-gunto.html">shin guntō</a> swords after 1935.</p>

<p>Japan successfully asserted itself on the international stage during Meiji period, winning wars against China and Russia and taking a role in the international response to Boxer rebellion in China. In July of 1912 a new emperor took the throne, known now by his posthumous title Taishō. Although he reigned for 14 years, his health and mental condition were poor and by 1921 his son, Crown Prince Hirohito was named sesshō (Prince Regent). It was probably during the Taishō period that real power in Japan came to reside with the military, although the expansion of Japan during this period was not so aggressive as it had been during the Meiji period or it would be during the subsequent Shōwa period after Hirohito was made emperor. Japan entered World War I in 1914 on the side of the allies and even sent a small fleet to the Mediterranean Sea to guard Allied shipping against German U-boats. However, Japan’s real purpose for entering the war was probably to position themselves to take over German interests in China, something which they accomplished in 1915. </p>

<p>Japan was firmly established in Taiwan and Korea prior to World War I, and probably already had designs on further expansion into China and the Russian Far East should the opportunity present itself. When asked to contribute 7,000 troops to an international expedition into Bolshevik Siberia, Japan responded by sending 12,000 under control of their own officers. A year later, they sent another 70,000 troops to occupy Russian ports. By 1922, pressures from the Red Army and American and British diplomats persuaded Japan to abandon their ambitions in Russia for the time. However, in 1931 Japan was on the move again, this time into Manchuria. This action committed them to the path that would take them into World War II.</p>

<p>This is an example of the short otsu version of the Type 32 army sword. It was probably issued sometime around 1920, most likely to a non-commissioned officer. Sometimes the marks within the hand guard include a date, however on this sword there appears to be only the Tokyo arsenal and a couple of inspector’s marks. </p>

<p>This is much more serious a weapon than the earlier <a href="1900-nco-kyu-gunto.html">kyu guntō</a>, reflecting Japan’s commitment to an expansionist agenda.</p>
