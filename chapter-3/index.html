<h1>Chapter 3. Japanese Swords, from Samurai to Saber and Back Again</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>The products of industrialism and the arms race in Europe were carried on steam ships around the world, enabling extensive European neocolonialism in the 19th century that left hardly any part of Africa or Asia untouched. Japan, a country that had remained secure in its isolationism for three hundred years, not only evaded this European colonialism but embarked on their own path of imperialism within a few years from their emergence out of a 300-year-long period of isolation. </p>

<p>	The black, steam-powered warships of the American Commodore Matthew Perry arrived at the port of Edo (Tokyo) in July 1853. With persistent negotiations, by March 1854, Perry achieved a treaty with Japan that allowed trade with the U.S. through select ports. This “opening of Japan” was both an opportunity and a crisis for Japan, which was still ruled through the feudal Shogunate system. The Shogun was a powerful warlord who claimed to be protector of the state in the person of the Emperor, while the Emperor himself had essentially no political power. </p>

<p>The Tokugawa Shogunate first came to power in about 1600, after an early interlude of contact with European merchants, primarily Portuguese, and Dutch, but, to a lesser degree, English and Spanish. This first wave of European contact brought in two things that were particularly destabilizing to the Japanese culture: guns and Christianity. </p>

<p>	The Japanese matchlock, which became known as the Tanegashima, was based on guns introduced by the Portuguese. They were produced in large numbers in the late 1500s and their use became a decisive factor in the wars that first established the Tokugawa Shogunate. In a departure from traditional warfare in Japan, the matchlocks were used to arm common foot soldiers, threatening the role of the samurai. However, once the Tokugawa Shogunate was secure, Japan entered its long period of isolation during which missionaries and other foreigners were expelled, and there was no longer a need for large armies. The matchlock, however, was not forgotten during the era of the Shogunate: rather, it became another weapon for samurai to study and excel at using. Becoming an object of ritual rather than warfare, the Japanese matchlock remained basically unchanged in design from 1600 to 1854, when the Japanese were confronted with the modern weapons on Perry’s warships.</p>

<p>	It seemed for a time after the initial negotiations with Perry, that government of the Shogun might permit the very sorts of concessions that had given the Europeans their inroads into other Asian nations. Motivated by this concern, the daimyo of the southern states of Satsuma and Choshu approached the young Emperor Meiji with an offer to support the formation of an Imperial army to oppose the Shogun and restore the Emperor to actual political power. This new army was again to be filled out with commoners trained with new European weapons, but led by officers from the samurai class of Satsuma and Choshu. After the forces of the Shogun were defeated in the Boshin War of 1868-69, samurai across the country were pensioned off and dismissed from their traditional roles. In 1876, the wearing of the traditional swords in public was forbidden. </p>

<p>	Saigo Takamori, the lord of Satsuma, who had been instrumental in helping overthrow the Shogun, was not pleased to see the total disenfranchisement of the Samurai. He instigated a rebellion in 1877, which resulted in the defeat of his largely samurai army, and the consolidation of the power of the Imperial Army. </p>

<p>	Following the defeat of the Satsuma rebellion, the Imperial Army and Navy became core institutions of the new Imperial nation. The new Imperial government took up the task of modernizing the country by promoting industrialization and education. Military academies and public schools were established, and many young people of the upper classes were sent to Europe for their educations, primarily to military schools. These upper-class young people came largely from the former samurai families, and so made up the majority of the officers in the first years after the restoration. However, as Japan transitioned from a rural agrarian economy to one more urban and industrial, with mandatory primary education for the first time, the army became more aligned with the general population. More importantly, as one of the major purposes of the educational system was to produce the best possible officers for Japan’s military, the educational system also placed high emphasis on patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor so that this military mentality permeated all of Japanese society.</p>

<p>	The Imperial Army in these years rejected the trappings of the samurai and modeled itself along the lines of European armies, some officers favoring the manuals of the French and others the drill of the Prussians. Regardless, the uniforms and the swords, as well as all the other weapons, followed European patterns. The swords of a samurai were unquestionably symbolic of their class, but they were also consummate weapons. For European armies at this time, swords were becoming progressively more symbolic of rank and authority than intended for actual fight, Prussian dueling societies notwithstanding. Even for cavalry, the saber was being superseded by the revolver and the carbine. So, for the Meiji Army, only the swords of the <a href="1920-japanese-type-32-otsu-army-sword.html">cavalry</a> were suitable for actual fighting. Nonetheless, the swords of Imperial Japan were important as symbols of power that derived from the Emperor. Swords were awarded to ranking officials in civic agencies like fire departments and city governments. A sword of this era was known as a <a href="1900-nco-kyu-gunto.html">Kyu guntō</a>. There was relatively little standardization of these ’swords’ designs, except for mass-produced swords for low-ranking and non-commissioned officers and standardized cavalry sabers. However, they all had knuckle guards and hilts resembling European swords, quite distinct from traditional Japanese swords. Officers from samurai background who purchased their own sword would often have their family emblem (mon) worked into the designs of the hilt.</p>

<p>	The path for Japan established by the Meiji was followed by his son, Yoshihito, who became Emperor in 1912 and ruled until 1926, an era known as the Taishō period. He was succeeded by his son Hirohito, posthumously referred to as Emperor Shōwa.</p>

<p>	As Japan rapidly transformed it industry, society, and military, it was determined to take a role equal to that of the European powers. The military chiefs of staff held sway over the Emperor with influence that was greater than that of the civilian government, and, more often than not, an army general held the position of Prime Minister.. If it was right for the European powers to hold territories in Asia, Japan deemed that it would be in their best interest to do so as well. Korea had been a choice target for Japanese expansion since before the time of the first Shogunate, with Japan mounting a major invasion in 1592. Japan was expelled by a coalition of Chinese and Korean forces in 1598, but the concept that Korea should be theirs lingered with the Japanese for hundreds of years. In 1876, the Japanese forced a treaty on Korea, perhaps inspired by the treaty forced upon Japan by the U.S. in 1855. The treaty ended Korea’s status as a protectorate of China, at a time when China itself was being cut into European spheres of influence. Over the following decades, Japanese interests in Korea expanded and Japan declared Korea a Japanese protectorate in 1905, officially annexing it in 1910. </p>

<p>	At the time when the Japanese were expanding into Korea, they also dealt with perceived threats from China and Russia. Japan gained major trade and territory concessions from China following the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), which led to a Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1895. As Japan was expanding west, Russia was attempting to expand to the south, seeking a warm-water harbor at Port Arthur and threatening the security of the Japanese in Korea. The Japanese Army and Navy proved themselves more than a match for the Russian forces in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), making the Japanese secure in Korea and leading to further Japanese expansion into Manchuria. Japan fought these wars with the same weapons as were being used in Europe and the U.S., some imported and some products of the growing Japanese industrial economy. The Japanese wore western-style uniforms and carried western-style, largely ornamental, swords.</p>

<p>	From the early years of the twentieth century, Japanese nurtured the conviction in their soldiers that their fighting spirit was intrinsically greater than that of any other soldier. This came in part because the cult of Emperor worship made the soldier ready to die for the Emperor, and that it was glorious to do so. It was also because the traditional spirit of the samurai had remained latent and reemerged so as to transform even common soldiers into warriors worthy of legend. With this transformation of the common Japanese soldier into a modern-age samurai, it was no longer appropriate to hold the European forms in high regard; it became even more appropriate to hold them in contempt. By the time of the Shōwa period, when Hirohito was Emperor, the Empire had nothing to fear from samurai; rather, the Emperor had armies of soldiers who felt themselves worthy to be samurai. In 1933, new uniform regulations required the return of swords in the style of the traditional Samurai weapons. These new swords are called <a href="1941-nco-shin-gunto.html">shin guntō</a>. </p>

<p>	Both the kyu guntō and shin guntō issued to low-ranking and non-commissioned officers were machine-made and of relatively low quality and adornment. While kyu guntō had the fitting of European <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1838-french-saber.html">sabers</a>, guntō were constructed with the traditional fitting such as tsuba (cross guard), habaki (blade collar), menuki (decorative grip inserts), kashira (handle cap), wrappings, and tip shape. Most have a hamon (temper line), although on machine-made blades this was artificially produced and strictly ornamental. There was a large amount of standardization on the fittings like the tsuba and menuki on shin guntō, so that they all matched Imperial standards, although the blades themselves varied greatly. Some blades were newly made but hand forged, and occasionally antique “ancestral blades” were refit to be used as shin guntō by the descendents of samurai. Although not very common, some ancestral blades were also reworked into kyu guntō with long, double-handed grips, giving them an appearance quite unlike a standard European sword. </p>

<p>	I have only visited Japan once, but I had the impression that for all the business suits you see, most Japanese are likely to still have a kimono in their closet. This is part of the impression of inscrutability they give to most Westerners, that they hold their ancient heritage in their secret hearts. The traditional Japanese sword is very much a part of that which is still hidden from us. </p>
