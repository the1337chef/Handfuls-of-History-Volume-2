<h1>Chapter 5. India and Nepal</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>The cultural landscape of India is extremely rich and complex, beginning with the prehistoric cultures of native peoples, which shaped the evolution of Hindu faiths and practices. Numerous other peoples added to and were themselves altered by this landscape over the last four millennia. One of the earliest Indian civilizations is only known to us through the archaeological record of large cities found throughout the Indus valley. The people who built these cities are referred to as Harappan, after Harappa, the first site to be excavated, in the 1920s. It is believed that they spoke a language of the Dravidian group, which is the root of other aboriginal Indian tribal languages. However, since no interpretable written texts survive, this is only a speculation. The Bronze-Age Harappan civilization thrived at about the same time as the oldest Egyptian and Chinese civilizations. Although it is likely that Harappan influences survived in subtle ways, affecting some of the many tribal groups of India, the nature of any such cultural legacy remains a mystery. </p>

<p>Shortly after the mysterious dissipation of the Harappan civilization at the dawn of the Iron Age, new peoples moved into South Asia; the people referred to as the Indo-Aryans. There are two major language groups indigenous to India: the older Dravidian and the later Indo-Aryan languages, which came with the introduction of Sanskrit and the original Indian oral and later written histories and legends. However, each of these two groups encompasses several hundred distinct languages. </p>

<p>The peoples referred to as the Aryans are likely to have been related to other peoples who also spread into the Middle East and Europe at roughly the same time, such as the Hittites and the Dorian Greeks. Whether it is most appropriate to consider the introduction of the Aryan people an invasion or a migration, the end result was a gradual transformation of the Indian cultures, as native tribes became Aryanized, and the religion of the Aryans also changed and evolved to accept the rich and diverse pantheon of the Hindu gods. As tribes were brought into the early Aryan kingdoms, the old gods of the tribes were often accepted as additional avatars of the primary Aryan gods such as Shiva or Vishnu. However, these hybrid gods were often not anthropomorphic but rather retained the character of ancient tribal totems, such as the elephant or the monkey. The elephant in particular, a symbol or even a prerequisite for kingly power in India, led the elephant god Ganesh to become an important object of Hindu worship. </p>

<p>As the Hindu faith matured in the last millennia BCE, other new faiths arose in India, most notably Buddhism and Jainism. The birth of Siddhārtha Gautama, who came to be known as the Buddha, has been variously estimated to be between 580 and 450 BCE. The earliest teachers of Jainism, Pārśva and Vardhamana Mahāvīra, date to roughly the same time. While the eight-fold path of Buddhism spread through much of Asia in various forms, and to a lesser degree the rest of the world, Jainism never spread much beyond India. It is estimated that there are presently about five million Jains in the world, 80 percent of whom live in India. </p>

<p>Neither Jainism nor Buddhism are particularly militant faiths, Jainism especially so, being associated with principles of nonviolence, so most of the weapons in this chapter are associated with other peoples. Many of the pieces are, in fact, related to Islamic peoples in India. While Islam does have a long history in India, the character of the Islamic kingdoms and Empires in India was different from those in the Middle East described in the previous chapter. While a significant amount of Persian influence eventually developed in the Arab-Islamic world, the Persian influence was very strong in India and blended with Hindu cultures into something distinctly Indo-Persian.</p>

<p>The first of the Islamic kingdoms in India were established by conquerors who came from the Persian territories of Afghanistan, around 1200 CE and established the Delhi sultanate, an Empire which covered much of northern India and endured until 1526, when it fell to Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. Babur was an Islamic convert, descended from Timur, who was himself a descendent of Genghis Khan. The Mughal Empire was the easternmost of the three “Gunpowder Empires,” which also included the Ottoman Turkish and the Safavid Persian Empires. These three empires, which stretched from Eastern Europe to the western edge of Southeast Asia, arose just as gunpowder weapons, in the form of matchlock muskets and castle-busting cannons, decided the rise and fall of nations.</p>

<p>Although the Mughal Empire came to dominate much of South Asia, its conquest was never absolute. Some Hindu kingdoms survived, mainly in the south of India, and also there were other smaller Islamic sultanates. Additionally, there were Sikh kingdoms in northern India after the founding of that faith in the 15th century by the guru Nanak. India was also largely spared the absolutism and intolerance of other faiths that typified the ascent of Islam in other regions, although, to be sure, there were occasions when Hindu or Buddhist shrines were destroyed of desecrated. With some exceptions, the Hindu majority peoples of India continued to prosper during the Mughal era, and likewise Hindu kingdoms often also benefited from Persian administrators and artisans. The official language of Islamic courts in India was more likely to be Persian than Arabic. The cross-cultural influences were so significant that the term “Indo-Persian” is often applied to items where the attribution to one culture or the other is ambiguous. </p>

<p>By about 1750, the Mughal Empire was in decline as many of the client states became, in effect, independent, although in some cases still paying token tribute to the Emperor in the capital, which was reestablished at Delhi. The situation of the Mughal Empire also became critical at this time because of the intrusion of Europeans whose intent was to conquer with commerce. For a time, the French played a hand in this game, but after the fall of Napoleon, South Asia became the special interest of the British East India Company. Both “The Company” and the British Crown took this game very seriously, since there was much money to be made. The Company would buy Indian textiles and ship some of them to other parts of Asia, where they would be traded for tea and spices. Always there was a profit. The profit was great enough to support whole armies of Indian recruits, Sepoys, in service to the Company. The recruits would get red coats and muskets, along with a better wage than they could have earned if they had stayed in their home villages. The British were also expert at using their power to play one Indian kingdom or sultanate against another. No matter who seemed to win in the short term, in the end it was always the British who came out on top. The Company also enforced the policy that whenever a ruler who was an ally to the English died without an immediate male heir, the Company would put the remaining family on a pension and just take over the kingdom. This game, which played well enough for the English in India, did not play so well when they took it to Afghanistan. English positions in the north of India near the Khyber Pass and the Sikh kingdoms were also never very secure. </p>

<p>In 1857, the East India Company might have lost it all, just for handing out the wrong ammunition to their Indian recruits; at least that is how the story is often told. In fact, at the time there was a great deal of unrest about the British rule in India, and something was bound to touch off a revolt sooner or later. What the English call “the Indian Mutiny,” the Indians call their “first war for independence.”</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the mutiny started because the British distributed rifle cartridges that were greased with animal fat to the native troops. Whether it was beef fat or pork fat, it hardly mattered; beef was anathema to the Hindu recruits and pork forbidden to the Muslims. Initially the revolt achieved a level of success that was sufficient for the last Mughal Emperor to declare his support for the movement. However, when the British brought in enough of their regular army to suppress the rebellion, they deposed the Mughal Emperor, and Queen Victoria was henceforth the Empress of India. The Company was dissolved in favor of the crown.</p>

<p>Even after the Mughal Empire was done away with, the stability of British rule in India relied on their continued good relations with many small kingdoms and sultanates within the British Raj. Empires are often the amalgamation of kingdoms ruled by client kings; as Herod ruled Israel for Rome, so too various minor kings and sultans continued to manage their domains within British India. When India at last achieved independence in 1950, there were more than 200 nominally independent “Princely States” incorporated into the new nation.</p>

<p>The culture and history of India is rich and complicated, and in most parts of the country the society is highly stratified. In the predominantly Hindu regions, this social stratification is associated with the ancient Hindu caste system, which, although officially banned now, still regulates social mobility and opportunities. The ancient castes are the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, and certain excluded groups referred to as the “untouchables,” The Brahmins were traditionally the religious caste, although they were often secular rulers as well. The Kshatriyas were the warrior caste, and so in most cases they were the wielders of secular power and the weapons that either realized that power or symbolized it. Vaishyas were essentially the upper middle class, owners of land, but not vast estates, and were often merchants. The Shudra were the fourth caste or “varna.” Their traditional roles were as servants or craftsmen.  </p>

<p>Europe rose from its dark ages in the middle of the second millennium. If India had a “dark age,” it was a thousand years earlier than that. There were great Hindu Empires, the Mauryan, the Gupta, and many other smaller ones in the centuries before Islam came to South Asia. These cultures were anything but primitive, especially in the context of global history. However, because of the inherent cultural stratification, what resulted was that the craftsmen produced exquisite goods that went to just the privileged few. This remained true in later ages through the Mughal period. </p>

<p>In some ways the cultures of India led the West. Tales came back to Europe during the crusades of the marvels of “Damascus steel.” The ingots of steel which the smiths of Damascus in Arabia cast into these famous blades originated in India. This steel, now referred to as wootz, was formed at high temperatures in crucibles through a process that has only recently been replicated in modern time by now renowned smiths, <a href="../modern-wootz.html">Rick Furrier</a> and Al Pendray. Somehow the process invented in India probably around the year 1000 produced steel with a micro-crystalline composition incorporating carbon in a lattice that gives the product the look of “watered steel.” Modern “Damascus,” which relies on the welding of multiple layers of different types of steel, has some virtues and aesthetic appeal, but in reality only counterfeits the ancient arts of India.</p>

<p>As with most of the world outside of Europe and America, India was slow to industrialize, able to produce beautiful and highly refined commodities, but only for those who could afford them. At the time when India faced its first crucial confrontations with European technology, the English too used hand-made weapons, but they were efficiently made in large quantities. With flintlock ignition, the European firearms of the 18th century also were technically advanced compared to those native to India, where matchlock systems were still used (See <i>Handfuls of History, Volume 1</i>). Mass production of machine-made firearms in England after 1855 tipped the odds strongly in favor of British for the ultimate control of South Asia at the time of the 1858 Mutiny. Arguably, the most iconic of all 18th- and 19th-century Indian swords is the <a href="1858-indian-mutiny-tulwar.html">tulwar</a>. Those owned by Indian nobles were beautiful works of art, while those in the hands of the British East India Company’s Sepoys were functional but unadorned. Many may have even used blades that were mass-produced in England. </p>

<p>In this chapter there are many weapons that appear exotic by Western standards, and each is an icon of one of the very diverse cultures of India. Some of these cultures like the Sikh and Coorg can still be visited in modern India. For others, all that remains are these tangible artifacts. </p>
