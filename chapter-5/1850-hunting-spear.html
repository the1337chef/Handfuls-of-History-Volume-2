<p id="date">1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> If you count all of the military muskets and rifles with <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/bayonets.html">bayonets</a>, then weapons that combine a barrel and a blade are not at all uncommon. However, discounting these somewhat banal examples, combination weapons are relatively rare. Most weapons that combine a blade and a barrel are standard sorts of edged weapons that have flintlock or percussion pistols grafted on to the hilt, like the <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1795-german-hunting-sword.html">hunting sword</a> in Chapter 2. Although bayonets are most often attached to long guns they are also, in rare cases, sometimes attached to conventional pistols, as in the case of the <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1830-british-bayonet-pistol.html">Halifax double barrel pistol</a> (also in Chapter 2). So while barrels and blades are sometimes attached to one another, this item is an extremely rare case where a barrel and a blade were cast as a single piece.</p>

<p>The style of the blade and its ornamentation would indicate that this piece most likely comes from India. The percussion ignition system built into the cast barrel suggests a date in the mid-19th century. Of course, what is missing is arguably as interesting as what is present, since this clearly is only the business end of an intricate and unique spear. Two big questions are left open, how did it work when it was complete, and what was its intended purpose? The uniqueness of this item can hopefully guide the addressing of these questions since this is quite likely a one-of-a-kind piece.</p>

<p>Some sort of firing mechanism had to be built into the final part of the spear shaft. Such a mechanism might either have been integral to a one-piece shaft, or I think it is possible that the mechanism might have been built into a separate section grafted between the spearhead and a solid shaft. Certainly, it might have been easier to build a mechanism into a separate segment of shaft and also easier to disassemble and repair, if the need arose, than if the mechanism were built onto the end of a full-length shaft. I have given some thought to trying to design and fabricate a firing mechanism myself.</p>

<p>Based on comparisons to guns built into canes and other shafted weapons, one internet acquaintance, who considers himself an authority, suggested that there would be a linking mechanism that would run the length of the inside of the spear shaft, so that a pommel at the end could be used to actuate a cocking mechanism. This might seem reasonable for a cane or riding crop where the length of the shaft serves as a barrel and the length of a cocking linkage would be short. It seems far less reasonable to imagine a linkage several feet in length to cock a mechanism for the discharge of a five-inch long barrel. Consider that to just prepare this barrel for a single firing must have required not only muzzle-loading of the powder and balls(s) but complete removal of the spearhead from the shaft in order to place the percussion cap. It seems likely to me that a cocking mechanism might have been actuated through the open mouth of the shaft while the spearhead was removed. Of course whether this would have been practical would have depended on the actual firing mechanism employed. It seems certain that the mechanism would not have relied on a conventional percussion lock and hammer grafted onto the side of the spear. Not only would this have ruined the aesthetics of the spear but would have been impossible to implement with the percussion nipple concealed within the shaft of the spear. It seems likely that a piston within the spear shaft, most likely spring-driven, would have been used to strike the internal percussion cap. Cocking then would have involved pushing down on the piston to lock it in place, something that might have been done with spearhead removed, using the same ramrod that was used for loading the barrel.</p>

<p>I suppose that a skilled gunsmith might have configured something like a conventional fold-out trigger, but since this firearm is unlikely to have been sighted and aimed like traditional guns, a simple release like a hidden button might have done as well. I also wonder whether the mechanism might have had something like an inertial release system, causing the gun to discharge when the spear was driven into target. In any case, if the weapon was to have been carried armed for any period of time it would have been good for it to have had some sort of safety to prevent accidental discharge. Such a safety might have been as simple a pin inserted through the side of the shaft that locked the piston in place.</p>

<p>It seems likely that this was a custom-made item for a man of some means, but for what purpose? It seems unlikely that anyone would carry a spear for personal protection, more likely it could have been a weapon of war, as spears often were. Consider though, how effective it would have been in the melee of battle. At first contact, the single shot it offered would have been surprising to an enemy and perhaps given an important momentary advantage against one opponent. After that point however, the weapon would have become simply a spear with a five-inch blade, of little use for anything but thrusting attacks. Moreover, this item is from the age of firearms, so that in battle the user would have been facing opponents who were likely to be armed with more purposeful guns. I seriously doubt that this was intended as a weapon of war.</p>

<p>I think that the intended purpose for this spearhead was as part of a hunting weapon. This would be consistent with the tiger head motif on the barrel. Even today, some people prefer to hunt game with traditional weapons, such as bows or black powder guns for the greater sport they offer. Whether the owner would have been brave enough to hunt tigers with this I cannot say, but certainly the single shot discharged at close range could have been a decided advantage over an ordinary spear. The concept of an impact-discharged firearm for wild animals survives today in the form of shotgun shell-loaded "bangsticks" that are used for defense of divers against shark attacks and by hunters to dispatch alligators.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that this spearhead survives without the rest of the weapon. Based just on the quality of the spearhead, it is likely that the complete spear would have been a very attractive item. Of course, many antique weapons, especially firearms, pass from being current and useful to simply being curiosities of little practical value, regardless of whether they later obtain value as antiques. Percussion firearms were passé by the beginning of the twentieth century, but people might still have had a use for a sturdy dagger. Perhaps this spearhead survived because in its present form it could still be used as a dagger or a knife.</p>
