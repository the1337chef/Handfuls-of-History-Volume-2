<p id="date">1858</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Tulwar is arguably the most iconic of all Indian swords. Its origins, like most sabers, goes back to the Mongols and other nomadic Turkic warriors. This legacy is shared with Persian <a href="../chapter-4/1780-shamshir.html">Shamshirs</a> and other similar swords. Likewise, the Europeans took the style of their 18th-century sabers from these types of swords, with so-called <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1944-marine-officers-mameluke-sword.html">Mamluk</a> swords retaining certain oriental features in the hilt design. The basic tulwar has a single edged blade, somewhat wider and less strongly curved than a shamshir. Often the curve of the tulwar becomes more pronounced toward the tip. Tulwars are readily identified by their hilts, which have disk shaped pommels and abbreviated cruciform cross guards. The pommel and guard bracket fit the hand rather closely and make for a tight, albeit somewhat cramped, grip. Some Tulwar hilts also have relatively basic knuckle guards extending from the cross guard to the pommel.</p>

<p>While most such saber-like swords are associated with mounted warriors, by the 19th century the Tulwar became the standard infantry sword of British Indian regiments. Of course by that time, the sword was a secondary weapon to a soldier's rifle or musket. Roughly 300,000 native soldiers were in British service in the mid-1850s, mostly enlisted in the armies of the East India company, which had acquired significant territories throughout India, particularly in the east, west and southern regions. In other areas, where they were not in direct control, the British also played a role in manipulating the balance of power between the various princely states. At this time, the Mughal Empire was very weak and also in danger of falling under British control. All of this British power relied on the large armies of native mercenaries, known as Sepoys, armed with British muskets and tulwars.</p>

<p>Earlier tulwars, like other Indian weapons, were often quite ornate, embellished with inlays and some were made of fine wootz steel. However, by the 19th century, relatively plain tulwars were produced in large numbers to arm the soldiers of the Mughal empire, the various princely states, and importantly, the native Indian soldiers enlisted as Sepoys by the British East India Company. Although hundreds of thousands of such swords were made, they were not "mass produced" in the modern sense, the final assembly, at least, was by hand and so each one was a little bit different. Some were made with European blades and native hilts, others were entirely produced by the foundries and shops of India.</p>

<p>The British pattern 1853 Enfield rifle-musket set a new standard for military long guns that lasted for about 10 years until the development of practical breech loading rifles using metal cartridges (see <i>Handfuls of History, Volume 1</i>). By 1853, British armories had adopted the "American system" of machine-based gun production that allowed for the manufacture of standardized high-tolerance interchangeable parts. The British army also relied in the use of mass-produced, standardized, paper-wrapped rifle cartridges that held pre-measured powder charges and an expandable Minié-type slug that made good use of the Enfields' rifled barrels. To make these cartridges easy to use they were pre-lubricated with grease, usually derived from some sort of animal fat. Standard drill required a trooper to use their teeth to help rip open the end of the cartridge before loading. There certainly were other under-currents of discontent amongst the Indian subjects of Britain in India at this time, but the introduction of these greased cartridges was a crucial spark that set off a mutiny of the native soldiers of the British army in 1857. Beef fat would have been anathema to a devout Hindu, as pork fat would have been to a Muslim soldier, only the Sikhs seemed to be indifferent to the issue. The British offers to provide ungreased cartridges that could be lubricated as the individual soldiers wished, or to alter the drill, permitting tearing the cartridges open by hand, came too late, and by April 1857 open revolt began to spread throughout the Sepoy regiments. The war lasted for over a year, and Britain brought in large numbers of regular troops to support the Company, its possessions, and employees (for more on the Indian mutiny see the entry on the sword <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1867-english-presentation-small-sword.html">presented</a> to the East Indian employee Francis Crozier). The British prevailed and the high casualties among the Indian soldiers paled compared to the civilian suffering from subsequent reprisals. Since the last Mughal emperor decided to side with the mutineers, his empire was another casualty of the war, both it, and the territories formerly controlled by the East Indian company, were merged into the "British Raj," and Queen Victoria became the Empress of India.</p>

<p>It is commonly estimated that about 100,000 native soldiers died in the mutiny, but a substantial number of mutineers were able to escape into Nepal. They were granted sanctuary but were relieved of their weapons when they crossed the border. Their swords and muskets were taken and stored in Lagan Silekhana, the Royal Armory of Nepal, where they remained to gather dust and rust for nearly 150 years. In 2003, two entrepreneurs/ adventurer investors, Christian Cranmer and Sudhir Windlass, acquired the inventory of Lagan Silekhana, amounting to approximately 100,000 items (for more on this story see <i>Handfuls of History, Volume 1</i>). For many years these items, which included guns, swords, and even cannons, most in unrestored or relic condition, were sold by Cranmer's International Military Antiques (IMA) and Atlanta Cutlery (representing Windlass steel in this country). In 2012, I made a visit to the warehouse of Atlanta Cutlery and hand-picked several items including this Tulwar, along with an Enfield <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/bayonets.html">bayonet</a> and the <a href="../chapter-2/part-2/1905-british-infantry-sergeant-broadsword.html">British (Edward VII) infantry sergeant broadsword</a>. I ultimately obtained a few other items from this cache, including two rifles, which appear in <i>Volume 1</i>, and a <a href="1904-long-leaf-kukri.html">kukri</a>.</p>

<p>I think of this tulwar, in spite of it being rather ordinary in appearance, as being special because of the provenance connecting it to the 1858 mutiny. It seems to have some unit marking on the hilt. There is a picture of the crate of Tulwars that were on offer in 2012. As of this writing (June 2015) neither Atlanta Cutlery nor IMA have any more Tulwars from the Nepal Armory available for sale.</p>
