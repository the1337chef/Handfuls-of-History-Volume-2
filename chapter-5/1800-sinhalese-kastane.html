<p id="date">Circa 1800</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The island nation of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, became a dominion of the British Empire in 1942 and an independent republic in 1972 when the name was changed to Sri Lanka ("resplendent island"). The majority people are the predominately Buddhist Sinhalese. The Sinhalese are traditionally associated with two weapons, beautiful <a href="1820-piha-kahetta-knife.html">piha kahetta</a> knives, and the richly symbolic kastane swords. The Sinhalese have a long history described in the entry on the piha kahetta. They trace their origins to a people exiled from India and their general conversion from the Hindu faiths to Buddhism about 300 years after their arrival on the island.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years Ceylon, like mainland India, had numerous princely states that vied for power on the island, with the strongest occasionally dominating the majority of the island. In the north there was the Hindu Kingdom of Aryacakravarti, while in the center of the island there was the Buddhist Kingdom of Dambadeniya. The kings of Dambadeniya brought to Ceylon a sacred relic, a tooth of the Buddha, which is still enshrined in a Temple of the Tooth presently located in the city of Kandy. The tooth was brought from India sometime after 1220, and as the dominant power in Ceylon changed from one kingdom to another, the Temple of the Tooth would be relocated from one capital city to the next.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1505, the kingdoms of Ceylon were beset by the Europeans who forced themselves as merchants or conquerors on all of the peoples in the accessible areas of Asia. The Portuguese were the first to establish themselves on Ceylon but their colonies passed to Dutch control in 1658, by which time the Kings of Kandy were in power on the island and had moved the tooth of Buddha to its present location. In 1802 the Dutch were compelled to surrender colonial power to the British. Throughout the colonial period, European control was often only effectively exercised in the costal areas, and local nobility who were agreeable with the European powers remained in control in their native dominions. Among the Sinhalese, the local rulers were given the military title, Mudali, which was borne only by the Kshatriya warrior caste. Symbolic of this distinction was the kastane sword. Kasthana is a Sinhalese term with the meaning of "Prince of Swords" or "Royal Sword."</p>

<p>It has been speculated that the kastane developed from a combat weapon to become a unique piece of Sinhalese court regalia, but such a lineage is hard to establish, especially in regards to swords with all the most distinct features of a kastane. The features of true kastane are most notable in the hilt. The pommel is in the form of a lion head and there are four quillions (cross guards), the lower two of which curve downward and onto the blade. The quillions take the form of mythical beasts known as Makara, creatures whose origin were as some sort of cetacean. The kastane blade is single edged and curved. The lion head of the pommel is admittedly rather fanciful and some people will argue that it maybe a dragon or other beast, but the Sinhalese maintain that it is a lion, as "sinha" (lion) corresponds to the name of the people, as well as the island itself, Sinhalese and Sinhala.</p>

<p>It is possible that there were early swords resembling kastanes that were heavier with longer double-edged blades, making them more effective combat weapons. Painting of ancient Sinhalese kings often show swords with the lion head pommel, but these are lacking the characteristic quillions. Therefore, it is more likely that prior to the colonial period, the warriors of Ceylon used a variety of weapons not too different from those on mainland India. It is fairly clear that by 1638 the kastane was already and only used as a symbol of rank and authority. While European dominion was challenged in other parts of Asia, such as with the Moro tribes of the Philippines, conflict in Sri Lanka was to be most bloody between the indigenous peoples, and not until after independence from Britian.</p>

<p>The most elaborate kastanes are the "Royal Swords," which were likely produced in the Royal workshops in Kandy for members of the ruling family, which retained at least nominal power until 1815. The skill of the makers of the kastane swords which were carried and displayed by lower ranking members of the court and civil authorities manifests primarily in the symbolism and beauty of the hilts, with very meager attention given to the blades.  The condition of the blade on this example is sad indeed.</p>
