<div class="text">
<p> The Gurkha of Nepal are not only famous for their defense of their native land but as mercenary warriors for great Britain, an arrangement established by the Treaty of Seguli in 1816. The traditional long sword of the Gurkha was the <a href="1840-sacrificial-kora-sword.html">kora</a>, but more famous, and of more enduring service, persisting after the kora was abandoned in favor of British muskets and rifles, is the kukri. The kukri has a forward leaning leaf-shaped blade, sharp on the inner edge. It is a true chopper, and like the kora, is also used for the beheading of animals for ritual sacrifice to the present day.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, the kukri used as standard equipment for Gurkha Regiments serving in the British Army was typically larger than those used by Gurkhas in the later 20th century. This is understandable because as a weapon, secondary to single shot muzzle-loaders of the time, it would necessarily be called upon to do heavier service than modern kukris used as a back-up to breech loading repeating rifles like the Small Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) rifles put into service prior to World War I. Also, having only just put aside their koras, it seems reasonable that the early military kukris would be large and more functional as a weapon.</p>

<p>This is a late Victorian/ early Edwardian era long-leaf kukri with Nepalese Negari script which translates as "3 Shri Chandra S(D) 9/57" indicating production date and unit assignment. Maharaja Sri Teen Chandra Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana was the fifth Prime Minister of Nepal from the Rana dynasty. He served in this capacity from June 27, 1901, so that "3 Shri Chandra" would suggest a production date of 1904, just a few years after the death of Queen Victoria. This may have been used by one of the more than 200,000 Ghurkas who served with the British during World War I. They served in virtually all theaters of the war.</p>

<p>This Kukri came from International Military Antiques and, like the Indian Mutiny <a href="1858-indian-mutiny-tulwar.html">Tulwar</a> is from the cache of items acquired from the Lagan Silekhana palace armory in Katmandu, Nepal (for more on this story see the "Treasures of Nepal" in Volume 1 of <i>Handfuls of History</i>) in 2003. Kukris are also used by civilians in Nepal and are produced as popular items for the tourist trade and general export. Tourist items are often engraved or otherwise embellished with brass badges and tooled leather scabbards. Kukris are often seen with two additional side knives fit to the scabbard.</p>

<p>The Kukri is widely copied and modern versions, varying greatly in quality, are sold by many companies, including well-known makers such as Ka-Bar and Cold Steel. However, as with any modern product, a famous brand name is no guarantee of quality with companies outsourcing production to the cheapest sources. Ka-Bar Kukris are made in Taiwan. Some are made of stainless steel, which is unsuitable for good serviceable blades. Such knives may look nice but would never provide the service of an original Nepalese Kukri, and of course are not pieces of history like this example.</p>
