<p id="date">Circa 1820</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Language is one of the things that define us as human beings. Differences in language are key discriminators and differentiators of cultures. Language is inherent to our thought processes, and the spoken word was the beginnings of our cultural evolution. Oral tradition however is fragile and mutable, while written language is the essence of history. The media upon which history has been inscribed has taken many forms over the millennia, from stone and clay tablets to now electronic media that can be shared worldwide in an instant.</p>

<p>The genesis of electronic print, now becoming the standard throughout most of the world, is relatively recent. Paper on the other hand, has been an indispensible media for writing in all forms, as well as for many forms of art, for hundreds of years. I wrote my Master's thesis in longhand to be manually typed onto paper, by a typist more skilled than myself. A few years later my Ph.D. thesis was the first of many documents I have since composed without benefit of paper.</p>

<p>Although paper, which was invented in China, has been used for perhaps two thousands years, papyrus manuscripts from Egypt predate the use of paper by at least a thousand years. Likewise, the use of processed palm leaves as writing material goes back to at least 500 BCE in India and South East Asia. The palm material, known as lontar, was prepared from the fronds of borassus or talipot palms. The process required several days of cleaning and drying before the material was cut into rectangular strips for manuscripts. Complete manuscripts might consist of dozens of sheets of lontar strung together so they could be held in order and looked through to follow the text. Usually lontar manuscripts had wooden top and bottom pieces that functioned as covers to protect the more fragile pages of palm inside.</p>

<p>In some parts of South Asia the lontar manuscripts were written or printed in ink, in other regions, especially southern India and Sri Lanka, the leaves were blackened with charcoal and oil to produce a dark surface on which a negative image could then be inscribed. This folding knife is an example of a lontar scribe's knife used for the preparation of palm manuscripts, a true "pen knife." The knife blade would have been used to trim the sheets of lontar to uniform size, and the needle would have been used for etching the blackened surfaces. The design of these knives was relatively standardized, with grips usually of ivory, as on this example, although wooden grips are also seen. The blades or handles often carry the name of the scribe, usually written in Tamil, or sometimes Sinhalese. These are the two languages of Sri Lanka, although there is also a large Tamil population in southern India. <a href="1820-piha-kahetta-knife.html">Piha Kahetta</a> knives from Sri Lanka also sometimes have channel in the sheath to hold a lontar scribing needle.</p>

<p>When either the pick or the blade is extended, the other serves to help lock the extended instrument in place. The pick forms from two legs that hinge at the base on either side of the hinge point for the blade. Both the pick and the blade have channels on the back for holding a strip of silver inlay. Some of the inlay remains on the back of the blade but it is missing on the pick.</p>

<p>Lontar manuscripts are especially revered on Bali, and lontar is still used for the rendering of especially sacred texts. Only specially trained and consecrated priests may prepare or handle lontar books. It is officially forbidden to sell lontar or throw away damaged texts. Instead they should be burned with special ceremony and offerings. Included are pictures of a Balinese lontar that escaped these prohibitions and found its way to eBay, where it was offered for sale by a vendor in the United States. The vendor described it: "Sanskrit Palm Leaf Manuscript; Abduction of Sita, Battle of Rama and Ravana." However, the writing is Balinese not Sanskrit, and it is an excerpt from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic which in its full form consist of 24,000 verses. The lontar is a portrayal of the rescue of the Princess Sita by her husband Rama, a climatic moment in the story. It is of no great age and has been restrung. The story itself is written with black ink on unstained lontar in typical Balinese fashion, and the illustrations were probably block printed. The wooden covers, however, look as though they were stained first and then the images were inscribed to give a white-on-black appearance.</p>
