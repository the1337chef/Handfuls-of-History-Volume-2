<div class="text">
<p> The bichawa (also bichwa or bichuwa) is an iconic, and sometime notorious type of Indian dagger. Unlike other Indian daggers, which are usually ostentatious and elegant, a bichawa was often intended to be concealed and surreptitious. It gained a reputation as an assassin's weapon and it is legendary that in 1659 the Marathas leader Sivaji used a Bichawa when he murdered Afzal Khan, a commander of the armies of the Sultanate of Bijapur, an Islamic kingdom that dominated south central India. The two men were pledged to meet unarmed to negotiate a peace but both, in fact, came armed. By some versions, Afzal Khan attacked first with a <a href="1856-katar.html">kitar</a> (katar) when they embraced in greeting, but Sivaji, who wore armor under his robes was unharmed and then struck Afzal Khan in the back with the bichawa he had concealed in his fist.</p>

<p>Bichawa comes from the Hindu word for a scorpion's stinger, referring to the curved nature of the blade and its use for a rapid stealthy strike. The other identifying feature of a bichawa is the loop handle, somewhat like the <a href="../chapter-8/1932-tiv-loop-dagger.html">loop daggers</a> of the TIV people in Africa. It has been suggested that the bichawa is based on the ancient horn daggers or <a href="1820-madu-buckler.html">maru</a>, shield and horn dagger combination weapons associated with Dravidians of south India. However, such weapons usually are double ended and far from easily concealed.</p>

<p>This example is quite old. Earliest examples of the bichuwa are believed to come from the medieval Vijayanagara Empire of southern India. The blade is double edged and the handle a rather simple strap with a single circular decorated disk. There are some markings on the blade of uncertain significance, perhaps put there by the maker.</p>

<p>Although never very common weapons, bichawas remained in use for several centuries, certainly into the era of the Mughal Empire. Later ones were often more decorative than this early example and occasionally were made with <a href="1780-double-bladed-bichwa.html">double blades</a>, departing from the simple image of a scorpion's tail.</p>

<p>Unlike other blades which might be held in the fist either blade up (forward grip) or blade down (reverse grip), the bichawa would most likely been used only with a reverse grip for striking an assassin's blow. Bichawas were sometimes used along with a weapon called <a href="1680-bagh-nakh.html">bagh nakh</a> ("tiger claws"), which were worn around the fingers like brass knuckles but had concealed blades within the closed fist.</p>

<p>Another thing unusual about the configuration of many bichawas is the configuration of the blade and handle. On nearly all swords and knives, where the center of grip and hilt or cross guard can define a plane (two-dimensional surface), the blade is in the same plane as the grip, so that the weapon will lie flat on a surface. Of course many weapons are elaborately constructed so that the hilt forms a basket, cup, or other sort of hand guard, preventing the weapon from lying flat, but even on these sorts of weapons, the blade is generally parallel to the hilt. Loop daggers, such as those used by the TIV, and many bichawas break this convention. The configuration of the handle and blade makes very good sense on the TIV daggers. The TIV daggers often have broad oversized blades and once the loop is placed on the hand, the blades lay in the plane of the palm not the plane of the handle. Presumably these daggers were intended to be worn by archers when shooting a bow. If the blade were perpendicular to the palm it would have been a danger to the archer when using the bow. On this dagger the reason for the perpendicular mounting of the blade may have simply been for ease of construction.</p>
