<p id="date">Circa 1880</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The bhuj is one of the most rare and unusual Indian weapons. They were most often used by warriors of the Hindu Rajput kingdoms in the Kutch area of Gujerat. The name bhuj, may have come from the city of Bhuj, which was once the capital of Kutch. Although on some examples the blade emerges from the mouth of a tiger or lion, an elephant head at the base of the blade is very characteristic of this type of weapon, so that they are sometimes called "elephant knives." The elephant is symbolic of both power and strength, as well as evocative of the god, Ganesh.</p>

<p>The weapon would be used primarily as an axe and is considered a cousin of the <a href="1810-zaghnal.html">zaghnal</a>, although perhaps in the hands of an adept it could also be used as a thrusting weapon or hafted sword. The shape of the blade is somewhat reminiscent of the European pole arm known as a glaive. While the short shaft would limit the reach, the bhuj could be used effectively in tight quarters.</p>

<p>As with this piece, there is usually a dagger concealed in the bhuj handle. The blade locks in place with a small rotation of the knob at the base. Since the bhuj is actually a rather heavy weapon, that would be most effective when wielded with two hands, it seems unlikely that the dagger would be used in one hand, in concert with the axe in the other. It seems more likely that these blades would have been used just as small knives or for concealed attacks with the bhuj itself serving to draw away attention.</p>

<p>A bhuj had been on my wish list for a long time and prior to buying this piece, I had been bidding on a very ornate, heavily gilded, example in the auction of the Edward Frey collection (from which I acquired a nice <a href="../chapter-7/keris/1900-surakarta-kris.html">kris from Surakarta</a>). It became clear during the on-line phase of bidding that the Frey bhuj was going to go for several times the pre-auction estimate, which was already exceeded when I was overbid. At that time, I found this piece on eBay, offered by a seller in India. The vendor's photos showed a piece with an expected degree of patina and the vendor described it as a "vintage replica". He was at least honest at that, this is not an original weapon. The blade appears to be cast iron, not steel, and as such, is unsuitable to take and hold an edge. I imagine that it might have originally been made during the Victorian period. It is generally an accurate representation of an original bhuj, except for the unsuitability of the cast iron.</p>

<p>What the vendor was not honest about was the condition of the item that he shipped to me. He must have had at least two of these since the condition of the one in his photographs was far nicer than that of the item I received. Where he showed patina, I received rust! Additionally, the concealed dagger was broken in the piece as I received it. Some of the pictures offer comparisons of what was advertised and what was shipped. I of course supplied appropriate negative feedback on eBay, which the vendor badgered me in vain to retract. The shiny piece shown in the majority of the pictures is how I got it back from a friend who removed the rust by bead-blasting and repaired the broken dagger.</p>
