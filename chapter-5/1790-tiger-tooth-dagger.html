<p id="date">Circa 1790</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This particular style of dagger originated in North India sometime in the 18th century or perhaps earlier. The name "Tiger Teeth" (Tigerzhan) appeared in an old booklet by Hermann Historica : DOLCH und MESSER aus dem PERSISCHEN KULTURRAUM. These daggers are usually associated with the Mughal Empire. Although the Indian word for dagger is "<a href="1740-mughal-khanjar.html">khanjar</a>," due to their Islamic association and their curved blades these daggers may also sometimes referred to as jambiyas. However, their resemblance to Arab pieces such as those made in <a href="../chapter-4/1950-omani-jambiya.html">Oman</a> and <a href="../chapter-4/1920-yemenite-assib-style-jambiya.html">Yemen</a> is rather slight. The Indian pieces have much higher quality blades both in regards to the steel and the craftsmanship. Often, as with this piece, the blades are made of "watered steel," true Damascus known as wootz. The edges are reinforced, and the tip is slightly thickened to make it useful for piercing armor. It is typical on these daggers for the ricasso bolsters to be deeply engraved, and often they are inlaid with gold koftgari. Unusually, on this piece the steel is pierced through, giving it, in my opinion, an especially elegant appearance. The other elements, such as the ivory grip, full tang with inlaid gold, and the tri-lobed pommel are characteristic of these particularly beautiful daggers.</p>

<p>The Mughals ruled the last great Islamic Empire in India. Although the dynasty was of Mongol origin, their culture was strongly influenced by that of Persia and Persian was the official language of the Mughals. The Mughal court was opulent and oriental, quite unlike that of the Arab Islamic Empires. The Mughal Emperor was an absolute monarch of a multinational state with a greater degree of religious tolerance than was typical of other Islamic states. Religious tolerance was required for the survival of the state, since in most parts of the nation the Muslims were in the minority. The Emperor appointed Mansabs to serve as governors of the territories within the Empire; these officials were usually Muslims and sometimes recruited from Persia.  Occasionally, authority was given to local leaders known as Zamindars who might not be Muslim. Their job was to collect taxes for the Emperor, retaining a portion for themselves and the maintenance of their local province, which would include equipping soldiers that could be called up for service to the Empire if needed. This dagger would have been in place at the Mughal court or with a Mansab or Zamindar who served the Emperor.</p>

<p>Although, as noted, these daggers were originally associated with the Mughals, they also later came to be sometimes used by Sikhs of the Punjab region of Northern India. Sikhism originated during the 15th century as a monotheistic departure from the local Hindu cultures. It was founded by Guru Nanak and spread by his successors. The Sikh religious practices were consolidated and formalized by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. Sikh initiation involves a baptism and acceptance of the five Keski. These include a turban protecting long uncut hair (kesh); the kara, a bracelet of iron or steel; a kirpan a dagger or sword; the kachehra, a cotton undergarment; and the kanga, a comb. It is the spiritual goal of a Sikh to become a "saintly soldier." While Sikhs initially lived in peace within the Hindu communities, they were seen as a threat by the Mughals who persecuted them and killed several of their gurus. This led the to the organization and militarization of the Sikh who formed a confederacy led by Ranjit Singh which, for a time, controlled the regions of the Kyber pass. The Sikh confederacy was later annexed into British India and the Sikhs became valued members of the British Indian armies, remaining loyal during the mutiny of 1858.</p>

<p>The Sikh kirpan (holy dagger) is a respected article of faith for the Sikhs of Punjab region. Typically, they have features in common with other Indian <a href="1740-mughal-khanjar.html">khanjar</a>, with a curved blade and often a horse head pommel. However, there is no hard and fast rule about the size and shape of the kirpan. Sikhs living outside of India often carry only miniature forms of the dagger as a symbol of their faith, although even those have created problems for Sikhs on planes, busses, and in classrooms. Probably as a consequence of the wars with the Mughals, the Sikhs became familiar with the Mughal tiger teeth daggers and consequently they became acceptable as kirpans. Perhaps the first tiger tooth kirpans were in fact trophies of the Sikh wars against the Mughals. The Sikh term for this type of dagger is reportedly "Jaam Dhar," which might be translated as "Demons Tooth."</p>
