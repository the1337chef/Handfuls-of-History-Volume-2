<p id="date">Circa 1900</p>

<div class="text">
<p> "Naga" is a name given to a tribal people in the far Northeastern edge of India. Naga is said to mean "pierced," in reference to the facial piercing of the Naga people. Several different tribes are associated with the term and they live in a state of modern India known as Nagaland. To the west and north of Nagaland is the Indian state of Assam. Also to the north of Nagaland are the tribal territories of Arunachal Pradesh and the lands of <a href="1870-garo-headhunter-dao-sword.html">Garo</a> people. The Indian state of Manipur is to the south of Nagaland and Burma is to the east. Because Nagaland is part of the modern nation of India, I have included the sword in this chapter, but arguably it might be more appropriate in the next chapter with the weapons of other South Asian tribes. For almost their entire history, the Naga people were isolated from mainstream Indian history and culture. Linguistically and genetically they are more related to other Mongoloid peoples of Asia than to the Aryan/ Caucasoid peoples of India.</p>

<p>The Naga remained outside the colonial interests of Great Britain up to the late 19th century, after which time they drew British attention because of their raids on the rich tea producing territory of Assam. At that time there was nothing at all "civilized" about the Naga, they were warlike headhunters. In order to protect their interests, the British sent several punitive expeditions against the Naga and ultimately resigned themselves to the need to pacify the area. The British established their headquarters at Kohima, creating a city which remains the modern day capital of the region. Although the British army was largely successful in their expeditions against the Naga, Christian missionaries accomplished the real conquest of the headhunter societies. Isolated from mainstream India culture and religions, the Naga had retained their ancient animistic beliefs. As the British were suppressing the Naga's headhunter practices, a cultural vacuum was created that made the Naga easy converts to Christianity. The largest building in all of Kohima is the cathedral, and it is probably the largest Christian church in all of India.</p>

<p>While the cultural conversion of the Naga has been extensive, especially for the people who have relocated from villages to cities, traces of the old Naga world persist in the countryside. These traces, of course, are progressively vanishing over time as the older generations disappear. Nagaland however, is an attractive and exotic tourist destination, less crowded than most of India. For the sake of the tourists, as much as for the natives, there is an annual Hornbill Festival in Kohima every year. The hornbill is a special totem animal for many woodland tribes of Asia. The modern Hornbill Festival is a seven- to ten-day event featuring people of Naga descent in recreations of their native costumes performing traditional dances and ceremonies. To increase its appeal to both tourists and the modern local people, the event also includes rock concerts, car and motorcycle races and even a rap music competition in the Naga language. While ostensibly the purpose of the festival is to preserve the culture of the Naga, it does so at the expense of commercialization. This is similar to what was inflicted on Native American cultures by Wild West shows. Just as Buffalo Bill offered reenactments of the Battle of Little Big Horn, some Naga provide reenactments of headhunter attacks.</p>

<p>This type of sword dao is the type used by the Naga for headhunter attacks, simpler but similar blades were used in the cane and rice fields as machetes. Modern copies of swords like this are carried by dancers in some of performances of the Hornbill Festival, and can be seen in YouTube videos of the festival. This sword has a very heavy blade with a single sharp edge, widening to maximum width at its very top. The wood grip has a silver collar, is covered in red enamel, and is capped with an ivory pommel. In correct Naga style, the scabbard is open on one side, bound with both a braided rattan band and braided silver wires to hold the blade in place. The inside end of the scabbard is decorated with gold paint. The open scabbard would, I assume, have been easier to make than a fully enclosed one. It shows off the blade, but protects it less than full scabbard would have. On the other hand, a full scabbard might have trapped dirt and moisture and an improperly stored blade would quickly have become ruined.</p>

<p>You can see in this sword the pride of a headhunter, who would have been expected to provide his village with trophies of his accomplishments. Reportedly, there are still stacks of human skulls to be found in some of the more remote Naga villages. The neighboring Garo people also have a tradition of headhunting, but their traditional sword is a more crudely fashioned <a href="1870-garo-headhunter-dao-sword.html">two-handed weapon</a>.</p>
