<p id="date">Circa 1700</p>

<div class="text">
<p> In 1526, Babur, a descendent of Genghis Khan and the later rulers of the Timurid Empire, led his armies out of Afghanistan to conquer the Delhi Sultanate and control the heart of Northern India, thus founding the Mughal Empire. The empire later expanded to the south and west, reaching back into Afghanistan by the time of the death of Akbar in 1705. The Mughal Empire was the eastern most of the three so-called "Gunpowder Empires" that stretched from the Black sea to the base of the Himalayan Mountains through the 16th and 17th centuries, with The Ottomans in the west, and the Safavid Persians in the middle.</p>

<p>Although the Mughal emperors could claim Mongol heritage, the culture of the empire was largely that of Persia, and later was shaped by the influence of the Indian peoples who were variously their subjects and adversaries. The arts of India at the time were well advanced and admired around the world. As weapons have always been symbolic of power, it is not surprising the rulers of the Mughal Empire, and the other Indian states, commissioned splendid works of art crafted as daggers and swords. These weapons were emblematic of power for Muslim and Hindu rulers alike. Many of these incredibly beautiful pieces reside in the permanent collections of important museums, and in the private collections of the very wealthy.</p>

<p>The decline of the Mughal Empire can largely be attributed to the British expansion of their commercial interests in India, especially since the East India Company maintained a strong military presence that played a hand in the internal politics of the many Princely States of India that were the erstwhile allies or enemies of the Mughals. The ultimate demise of the Mughal Empire came after the last Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, announced his support of the Sepoy regiments of native soldiers in service to the British, who rebelled against their masters in a mutiny that began in 1857. After the defeat of the mutineers in 1859, the British deposed Bahadur Shah II and Queen Victoria was declared by the English parliament to be Empress of India. There was no plebiscite of the people of India.</p>

<p>India in the time of the Mughals was a land of great contrast between the magnificent opulence of the rulers and the abject poverty of the common people. It is not so very different for the poorest people of India today than it was then, although today the display of wealth by the mighty has been tempered and there exists a large relatively well-off and well-educated modern middle class.</p>

<p>Although the generals of the Mughal Empire fought and won their share of battles against the native Hindu princes and lesser Muslim Sultans of India, the long-term success of the Empire also relied on diplomacy. The Emperors held sway over many kings, some by conquest, others by treaties that allowed for mutual advantage or defense from common enemies. The Mughal rulers frequently made gifts to their vassals and allies in the forms elaborately fashioned and ornamented weapons and armor. This dagger might have been such a gift, or alternatively a wealthy noble may have commissioned it for himself or a family member.</p>

<p>This sort of knife is known as a kard. One of the two <a href="../modern-wootz.html">modern wootz</a> knives made by Rick Furrer is a kard, with a straight-backed single edged blade and integral bolsters. The <a href="../chapter-2/part-1/1300-medieval-knife.html">medieval Dutch knife</a> is similar to a kard, except that there is a slight drop in the back of the blade as it reaches the point. Most kards, like the Furrer example, have simple grips that flow from the lines of the bolster.</p>

<p>Many forms of Indian daggers, such as the <a href="1680-bichwa.html">bichwa</a>, <a href="1740-mughal-khanjar.html">khanjar</a>, <a href="1700-khanjarli-dagger.html">khanjarli</a>, <a href="1790-tiger-tooth-dagger.html">tiger-tooth</a>, and <a href="1780-chillanum.html">chillanum</a> have curved or recurved blades, quite unlike the kard blade. This blade is rather like that of a <a href="../chapter-4/1855-khyber-sword.html">khyber knife</a> or an Afghani <a href="../chapter-4/1980-afgan-choora-knife.html">choora</a>. These blades differ from that of a true kard largely by being hollow ground so that the back edge is formed into a "T." Except for this, the Khyber sword (shown in some of the photos) is very much an oversized kard, even in regard to how the base of the hilt is enveloped in the scabbard.</p>

<p>The popularity of the kard-like blades amongst the tribes in the region we now know as Afghanistan (there was no Afghan nation prior to 1747), suggests that perhaps this dagger was made for one of the Emirs in that area that the Mughals wanted to make terms with, perhaps to sway him away from Persian influence. At the time this knife was made, commerce between the Safavid and Mughal empires would have been difficult because of the various Pashtun, Tajik, Uzbek, Pashai, Arab, and Turkmen (to name but a few) tribes that controlled the mountain passes and dessert caravan routes that crossed into the western frontier of the Mughal Empire. As noted above, by 1705 the Mughal territories extended into Afghanistan as far as Kabul and Kandahar, but Turcoman territories further west, like Herat and Farah were still independent. It is certain that the Safavid and the Mughal empires were playing their own version of "<a href="../chapter-4/1890-great-game-pulwar.html">the Great Game</a>" in the 17th and 18th centuries trying to deal with these tribal domains.</p>

<p>While the kard-like blade of this dagger is very much in the fashion of the knives of the Khyber and Afghan tribes, the horse head hilt is very indicative of the Mughal arts of the era. In <i>Arms and Armour at the Jaipur Court</i>, Robert Elgood illustrated three daggers with horse head hilts. Two of them are khanjars with curved blades (pages 34 and 70); the other (page 56) is an example he refers to as a chhuri that has a straight blade. He also reports that the poet Kalim Kashami, wrote of the Emperor Shah Jahan, who ruled from 1628 to 1658, "The handle of his dagger is in the form of a horse, for victory to ride on the day of battle."</p>

<p>The steel of this kard is high contrast wootz. One of the photos compares it to the finer grained wootz of the Khyber sword. The cast hilt is sheathed in gold and engraved. The gold shows slight wear at some of the high point around the ears and muzzle. The eyes are probably rubies or possibly garnets.</p>
