<div class="text">
<p> After the fall of Spain to Napoleon in 1808, wars for independence swept across South America, stripping Spain of most of its colonies by the mid-19th century. Wars for independence came much later to Spain's island colonies such as the Philippines, which did not begin an organized war for independence until 1896. In 1898 the native forces, led by Emilio Aguinaldo, were close to victory over the Spanish. However, they were robbed of their success by the treaty of Paris that sealed the end of the Spanish-American war and ceded the island territories of Spain to the United States. The treaty stipulated that the Spanish remaining in the Philippines would surrender only to American forces. Prior to the American occupation, the Philippine nationalist forces were encouraged to believe that the Americans would support their independence, but they were deceived. The Americans arrived determined to fight and win the war the Spanish had been about to lose.</p>

<p>From February 1889 to July 1902 the army of the First Philippine Republic, joined by guerrilla forces and native militia, fought a losing battle against the U.S. expeditionary force. Following the surrender of General Miguel Malvar on April 16, 1902, the acting Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed that the Philippine-American War was over, although resistance continued in more remote parts of the islands, especially in regions control by the so-called <a href="1800-moro-kampilan.html">Moro</a> (Islamic) tribes until 1913. During the three years of war it is likely 20,000 Philippine soldiers and 34,000 civilians were killed, along with over 6,000 American soldiers. Blades like this dahong palay, which in peacetime might have been used to clear fields, became favored weapons of the citizen soldiers of Philippine Revolution and the subsequent war against the American invaders.</p>

<p>The dahong palay, takes it name from the shape of the blade, which is said to resemble the eponymous rice leaf, as well as a venomous snake of the same name. This blade form is usually associated with the Tagalog people of central Luzon, but this particular example also shows features associated with weapons of the neighboring Ilocano people, such as the brass cross guard and integral ferrule. The bent tang and shape of the "horse hoof" pommel are also consistent with older Ilocano work. The heavy 24.625-inch blade has faint signs of lamination and appears to have a hardened edge that shows signs of serious use. The blade has been fitted to the hilt perfectly. The initials "F.S." are incised deeply at the forte and are most likely a maker's mark, similar to what is seen on the Philippine <a href="1850-parang-nabur.html">parang</a>, that has a similar, albeit smaller, blade.</p>

<p>There are a couple of very small, minor areas of damage to what is otherwise an impressive hilt of carved horn. Scratched on the hilt is "9th Virginia Regt." and the name "John Q. Leaper." After the name, the year 1861 is inscribed. This seems too early to be the date of the sword, which at first led me to speculation that it might be the birth date of Mr. Leaper.</p>

<p>The marks scratched into the hilt are very faint. In a couple of the photos I have tried to enhance them with talcum powder. The person who sold me this sword, a knowledgeable member of the Viking sword forum read the name as "John Ikaver" and claims that he missed Virginia regiment inscription entirely. Once I pointed out the presence of the second inscription, he almost expressed seller's remorse because that inscription could connect this sword to one of the most notorious incidents in the Philippines-American War and significantly increase its collector value.</p>

<p>The 9th infantry regiment has been a highly distinguished unit throughout American history. During the Boxer rebellion they took a nickname of the Manchu Regiment and served in nearly every major conflict. The 9th saw duty in the Philippine war and was the principle unit involved in the massacre of Balangiga in Samal, September 28, 1901. In the first phase of the tragedy, locals massacred 48 members of the 9th Regiment's company C during a surprise attack. In a black act of retaliation, Gen. Jacob H. Smith ordered Marines and other units of the 9th on a punitive expedition with the command to execute every male over the age of 10, or in some accounts, "every person over the age of 10." What began as the United States Army's worst defeat since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, became one of the most infamous acts of the U.S. military on a civilian population, to rival Wounded Knee and the Mi Lai massacre. Smith was reprimanded but not formally punished, although he was forced into retirement from the service.</p>

<p>American historians place an estimate of around 2,000 civilian casualties in the aftermath of the Balangiga attack, however Philippine historians place the figure closer to 50,000, a number agreed to by American historian Kenneth Ray Young. In addition to the attack on civilians, the U.S. soldiers looted the village, most notably taking the church bells of the town, saying that they had been used to signal the original attack on Company C. Although the government of the Philippines has asked for the return of the bells, they are still held at U.S. military camps.</p>

<p>I have not been able to confirm an association between the names of the person and the regiment inscribed on this sword, but it seemed plausible that it could be a relic from that horrible event. It might have even been used by a native in the original attack and then collected as a souvenir after the retaliation.</p>

<p>However, a couple of points challenge the above interpretation of the inscriptions on this sword. If 1861 was John Leaper's year of birth, then he would have been forty years old at the time of Balangiga massacre, which itself is not a problem, but why would he but his birth year and not the year he obtained the sword? The bigger problem is lack of a clear connection between "Virginia" and the 9th Regiment that fought in the Philippines. There was a 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental army. It was formed prior to the Revolution but it was disbanded on November 15, 1783. There was also a 9th Virginia Regiment in the Army of the Confederacy, and that unit was formed in July of 1861. It is also possible that the number is not 9 but a European-style crossed 7, but that hardly matters since there was also a 7th Virginia Regiment in the Army of the Confederacy, which was formed in May of 1861, as well as, one raised in 1776 for the Continental army. In any case, by the time of the Philippine war it was no longer customary to identify U.S. military units with specific states unless they were volunteer units recruited for specific conflicts such as the Spanish American War. Furthermore, the U.S. 9th infantry regiment that fought in the Philippines was first formed in Maryland, not Virginia.</p>

<p>All of the above considerations leave us with a Philippine sword from circa 1900 that might have come to the U.S. as a trophy from the Philippine war. However, the inscriptions on the hilt are suspect. A totally different avenue of speculation comes from the fact that there is today a third incarnation of 9th Virginia Regiment, in the body of re-enactors. Confederate soldiers would not always be expected to have standard issue weapons, nor would all reenactors necessarily know a sword made in the Philippines from one made by a Virginia blacksmith. Nonetheless, most reenactors do take pride in the authenticity of their replica weapons. The pieces just don't fit. Is it plausible that this is not from the Philippines at all and really was made by a Virginia blacksmith (F.S.) in 1861? The more I looked at this sword and thought about it, the more reasonable this idea seemed to me. However, it is also true that Civil War, and especially Confederate, provenance can increase the value of an item for collectors. It is possible, and perhaps even the most likely, explanation, that someone etched these lines in an effort to give it such a false association. They might have done better if they had etched "9th Manchu Regt." and made the date 1901 instead of 1861.</p>
