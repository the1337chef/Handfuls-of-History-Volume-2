<p>The keris (kris) dagger is the most iconic weapon of the entire Malaysian archipelago. For many cultures the keris was symbolic of manhood and a position in society. Each dagger is easily recognizable as a keris but they also vary greatly from one to the next in their details. The keris is venerated as a sacred weapon throughout most of the islands of Indonesia, Malaysia, and other parts of Southeast Asia. The old flag of Siam had a pair of crossed keris daggers. The most recognizable feature of a keris is the long thin blade, which widens asymmetrically at the top. It has been suggested that the origin of the keris may have been from repurposed stingray spines. However, although there is some archeological evidence that ray spines might have been adapted as weapons, this part of the legend of the keris probably comes from early legends that when a keris was made it had poison imbued into the very steel of the weapon. Although some peoples may have treated their keris blades with poisons, it was a treatment that doubtless had to be renewed.</p>

<p>The first keris were probably inspired by weapons of India, as the Hindu/Buddhist cultures began to establish themselves on the islands. The spread of the keris to other nations such as Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines has been credited to the growing influence of the Majapahit Empire in Java around the year 1492. An early form of the Keris dagger is known as a <a href="../1200-majapahit-keris.html">Majapahit</a> dagger. These are made of a single piece of metal and usually have an anthropomorphic figure as a handle. </p>

<p>Keris hilts (handles) vary greatly in materials, form, and decoration. They are the feature most likely to identify a keris with a particular island or people. They are sometimes post-like (as on the <a href="1850-javanese-keris.html">Java</a> keris) but often folded over into a sort of pistol grip, as on the <a href="1910-bugis-keris.html">Bugis</a> example. Sometimes, especially on keris from <a href="1860-bali-keris.html">Bali</a>, the hilts are caved as demons or gods, however, since Islam discourages figurative art, hilts may only have highly stylized representations, as on the example from <a href="1850-javanese-keris.html">Java</a>. There is usually not a pommel, except on the large examples attributed to the Moro people of the Philippines. These <a href="1890-moro-kalis.html">Moro</a> pieces, also known as kalis, are actually more swords than daggers, but they are made to emulate the traditional styles of the smaller blades.</p>

<p>The Indonesians have dozens of words for the minute variations and subtle features of Keris blades. For our purposes we will focus on just the major features. The blade has a thin tang, which is invisible in an intact weapon, enclosed in the handle. Although the basic asymmetrical shape of the blade at the top is fairly consistent, the blades themselves are either straight or wavy. If the blades curve, there are always an odd number or curves, usually three to seven, but sometimes many more. Each curve is called a “lok.” The top of the blade next the hilt is nearly always a separate piece of metal, called the ganja (or gandja in Java).  Sometimes there is a false ganga simulated by an etched line. The ring or cup between the blade and hilt is variously called the mendak, selut, or uwar. </p>

<p>Spines (Janggut), sometimes curved and hook-shaped, sometimes just spike-like, are often found on the sharp outer edge of the ganja (the aring) and the flared upper portion of the blade. When they are curved, the curve is downward, pointing away from the hilt so that they might catch an opposing blade. Sometimes there is a single curved hook on the opposite side, below the blunt end of the ganja (the dagu). This is referred to as the Belalai gajah (elephant’s trunk). The trunk curves up and toward the hilt and would not catch a parrying blade but might deflect it. Sometimes there is spike within the curvature of the trunk called the elephant’s tusk (as on the <a href="1890-moro-kalis.html">Moro</a> kalis). Occasionally (28 percent of 275 keris examined*) spines are absent from both edges. </p>

<p>Some relatively rare examples will have a carved image on the outside surface of the dagu. Out of the 275 keris and kalis on the Oriental Arms site only nine had such carvings, two had snakes (Nagas), two had demon faces, and two had other mythical creatures. These six were all attributed to Bali (out of a total of 39 Balinese Keris, 15 percent). Three of the remaining 236 samples, including the <a href="1910-bugis-keris.html">Bugis</a> example from the island of Sulawesi in this collection, had lions carved into this edge. The carving of a songo (lion) on a keris is indeed traditional and old but it is also the case that these are not always original to the blade and may have been added later. The image on the <a href="1950-naga-kris.html">Naga</a> kris in this collection is rather crudely rendered, and may even just be some generic demon.</p>

<p>Sheaths are usually made in two or three pieces of polished wood, sometimes with silver covers or other decorations. Each sheath is made to custom fit a specific keris. The broad upper cup made to fit the ganga is the sampir and the lower section that houses the blade is the sarong. Sometimes there is a separate end-cap called a buntut. Like other keris features, the sampirs vary in ways that help identify the origins of specific pieces. They can be relatively square, as on the <a href="1910-bugis-keris.html">Bugis</a> example, bean shaped as on the <a href="1860-bali-keris.html">Bali</a> keris, or boat-shaped, with or without high-curving prows. Scabbards with no pronounced sampir, as seen with the <a href="1950-naga-kris.html">Naga</a> kris, are identified as the Madura type (G.B. Gardner in <i>Kris and Other Malay Weapons</i>, Figure 13). These scabbards are also known as the kojongan or kekojongan style, and are sometimes used in Bali or Lombok, as well as Madura. </p>

<p>	The keris blade is made from a special form of pattern welded steel known as pamor. The pamor can be forged into various patterns with different names, and each pattern is said to have its own magical powers. The irons and steels used in pamor vary in nickel content and traditionally include rare meteorite iron. The meteorite iron was one of the first ferrous metals available to the islanders, and since it came from the heavens, it was believed to have very special powers that were imparted to the weapons. The fused and welded metals are etched with acids to bring out the patterns. </p>

<p>	The keris can, of course, be deadly (especially if, in fact, the blade is laced with poison), but they are not the most robust of weapons. Most keris are relatively short, with blades of only 12–17 inches, and so, being thrusting weapons, they have relatively limited reach. The thin tangs are also a structural weakness and can bend or break with hard use. Traditionally, a warrior would carry three keris, one a gift from his wife’s father, a second that would be an heirloom from his own family, and a third that would be his personal choice. The very act of carrying three is something of a statement that one for each hand might not be enough. For serious warfare, the keris was most often a secondary weapon with the warrior’s primary weapons being a spear or heavier sword.</p>

<p>	There is a form of the keris called a <a href="1887-penjang-keris.html">penjang</a>, which has a relatively long blade, although not of particularly more robust construction than other keris. The penjang blade is slender and usually about 18–23 inches long. Most are attributed to Sumatra. They are often referred to as “execution swords.” Reportedly, a condemned prisoner would kneel and the penjang blade would be run down through a pad of cotton placed on the gap of the collarbone. The blade would pierce the heart and other vital organs, resulting in rapid death. The pad of cotton would serve to wipe the blade as it was withdrawn. While this story is plausible, the penjang is actually a relatively common form of keris so that the percentage which were actually used in this manner is probably rather small. Most penjang were probably just intended to be used as swords.</p>

<p>	Although the public display of personal weapons is officially discouraged in the modern nations of the islands today, the keris remains a potent symbol of Indonesian and Malay nationalism. They are kept as family treasures and worn on formal occasions. Interestingly, modern Indonesia has permitted the descendents of the old sultanates, who ruled from precarious thrones during the colonial era, to retain their titles and even some political powers. There is still a sultan of Yogyakarta and a Susuhunan Surakarta on Java. The holders of these hereditary positions hold court, although not in as elegant a fashion as two hundred years ago, and, of course, their palace guards carry a keris.</p>
