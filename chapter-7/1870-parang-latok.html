<p id="date">Circa 1870</p>

<div class="text">
<p> I imagine that it might have come as something of a surprise for the Dayak peoples of Borneo to learn that there were unfamiliar people who claimed to "own" their island. The first to make that claim were the Dutch and then it was declared part of the modern nation of Indonesia. If the Dutch did indeed own Borneo, they never did much with it. The Indonesians, however, have been working at selling off its resources, primarily to foreign investors, Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans, who have been cutting down the exotic woods of the rainforests for several decades.</p>

<p>I think that just the concept of "owning" land would be foreign to the native peoples of Borneo who live by making peace with the land. Their wooden longhouses, which rise on stilts on the river shores, are made of the very stuff of the forests. The natives practice primitive slash and burn agriculture converting small plots of forest, usually on the opposite riverbanks, into temporary fields that will be sufficient for subsistence farming, single year rice paddies, and limited production of a few cash crops such as rubber. They otherwise draw what they need for their lives from the forests and the temperamental rivers that spread like vines of spider webs from the central highlands to the coast. The frequently flooding rivers are the givers and takers of life to the Iban Dayaks.</p>

<p>Tribal groups will know something of other tribes that may be up river or down river of their own base but have little contact or knowledge with those in the neighboring river basins that are separated from their own by thick jungle forests. Until very recent history there was very little travel from the interior regions to the coast except by the capricious river negotiated by fragile canoes. The tribal villages would be visible over the riverbanks or identifiable by the communal latrines perched over the river near the shores.</p>

<p>The tribes of Borneo were notorious as headhunters, keeping themselves isolated from the peoples who came to inhabit the coastal areas. There were seafaring tribes that lived on the coast and conducted trade with, or piracy on, peoples of other islands. The inland tribes would war on each other, with the more inland tribes feeling sometimes superior to those who lived downriver. Human trophies would be collected among traditional enemies in reciprocal fashion. Any important new project, like a longhouse for many families, would require a spirit offering provided by an enemy's head.</p>

<p>Muslim tribes established themselves along the northern coast of the island in areas that are now Brunei and provenances of Malaysia. The Dutch established a few stations around the rest of the island, which led to the bulk of the island being brought into the modern nation of Indonesia when independence from the Dutch was achieved in 1949. However, neither Islam nor the European influences reach very far into the interior of the island until the 20th century, and the old spirits of the jungle, like that of the hornbill, prevailed.</p>

<p>As noted above, the modern era brought impetus to exploit the jungle's resources. Headhunting was forbidden and now roads have been built to reach deeper into the forests. Denied their old ways, the tribal people began to tolerate Christian missionaries and many now make a claim to be Christians. In the interior of the island, churches, albeit small and simple ones, are much more common than mosques that will mostly be found in settlements populated by Indonesians from the other islands.</p>

<p>This sword is a Parang Latok (which is also known as Latok, Latok Buku or Parang Pathi) from Kalimantan, the interior of Indonesian Borneo. It certainly could take a head but would also function as a machete. It is originally from the John Woodman Higgins Armory Collection and was acquired in 1946. As with other types of tribal swords, such as the Moro <a href="1800-moro-kampilan.html">kampilan</a> or the Dayak <a href="1890-dayak-mandau.html">Mandau</a>, the hilt of this sword was originally decorated with tufts of hair. The plugs where the hair was once inserted are visible but only a single plug remains, perhaps symbolic of how our ability to hold on to history is forever diminishing.</p>
