<p id="date">2016</p>

<div class="text">
<p> To a certain degree there is no clear separation between ceremony and everyday life in Bali. Although I cannot claim to have seen very much of Bali, I was fortunate to spend several days on the island as a side trip to a scientific conference on betel nut that I attended in Kuala Lumpur. I never got anywhere near the popular beach resorts, instead I went to the small city of Ubud in the southern interior of the island, and mainly I was in the tiny village of Nyuh Kuning, where the Villa Beji Indah was located, about a mile away from the center of Ubud. The Villa Beji Indah is a complex of pools, gardens, villas, pavilions, and bungalows, on a verdant hillside over a picturesque gorge and waterfall. A walk through the village takes you past traditional Balinese home complexes, temples, and shops to the south entrance to the sacred monkey forest and a path to Ubud. Ubud is a small town but filled with tourists, it is famous for being a center for art and culture.</p>

<p>I flew into the capital city of Denpasar and was met by a driver from the Villa Beji. The traffic was intense on the progressively narrowing streets, dominated by careening motor scooters, some heavily overburdened with passengers and goods. The 90-minute drive eventually took us out into the country side where manicured terraced rice fields flanked the road. Traffic would slow somewhat to accommodate the women walking stately with their tall baskets of offerings on their heads. It was common to see women carrying goods this way, but never men. The women who worked at building sites wore special flat-topped hats and could be seen carrying apparently very heavy loads of earth or bricks.</p>

<p>The Balinese have a special relationship with their place on earth, which includes the Hindu gods, the spirits of their ancestors, and the living world around them.  Each day when the women cook they will set aside some of the food for offerings which they will place at the statutes or temples of their village or at the threshold of their home, or even on the seat of their motor scooter.</p>

<p>There are usually at least three temples in a Balinese village. As the village is thought to be aligned on an axis from the celestial to the chthonic, corresponding to the part of the village closest to the central mountains or the surrounding sea, respectively. The Pura Puseh (temple of origin) is the most sacred and is located at the highland (kaja) end of the village and is dedicated to the worship of Brahma.  In the center of the village is the Pura desa that is dedicated to the most important deities to the local people. It also serves the function of being a main gathering point for the people of the village for worship and festivals for Vishnu, the avatar of god most often venerated here. The third temple is the Pura dalem, located at kelod (down-hill) end of the village, dedicated to the worship of Shiva, and often associated with the village cemetery. The Balinese practice temporary burial prior to a final cremation (if it can be afforded).</p>

<p>Each temple is also arranged in three sections, with an outer court where daily business may transpire, a middle court for ceremonies, and an inner court for the priests and high officials. Large private family compounds are often organized in a similar fashion with an outer court for guests and visitors, an area just for family, and then an inner shrine for family worship. In Bali you will see that the statues and even the trees are cared for and often dressed in sarongs.</p>

<p>Bali is a land with sacred images of the spirits that fill the land, some divine, some quite earthy. Animals become humanized and visa versa. Many of the statues are old but the native art is a dynamic part of daily life as well, as evidenced by the statue of the sandal-wearing, scooter riding simian couple.  The pictures of Bali begin with the woman taking her offerings down the busy roadway. There are several pictures of statues in the sacred monkey forest of Ubud, and a few pictures of the monkeys. One picture is of monkeys in the cemetery for temporary burial. There are pictures of temples and offerings, the guardians of a home compound, and the statue of Ganesh, which greets guests upon arrival. There are images of just some of the sculptured spirits to be seen around the village of Nyuh Kuning and one woman making her daily offering at the central village shrine. There are a couple of pictures from a Dance performance at the Ubud palace.</p>

<p>The last sequence of Bali pictures were taken at what remains of the Klunkung Palace, the kraton of the last sacred kings of Bali. There were many kingdoms in Bali, but the oldest and most revered was that of Klunkung. For most of the colonial period Bali was off of the main path of European intrusion. However, a couple of incidents let to a Dutch invasion of the island in 1906. The Balinese mounted only symbolic resistance that culminated in 1908 in a puputan ("the finishing"). The royal family of Klunkung and their retainers marched out in formal array with only traditional weapons, allowing themselves to be slaughtered by the Dutch.</p>

<p>There are pictures of the grounds of the compound and one of the royal pavilions with classic Balinese art telling intertwined stories of history and mythology.  The last two pictures are from the museum and show some of the kris daggers recovered from the puputan and a wedung. Unfortunately, they did not photograph well through the glass case.</p>
