<h1>Chapter 7. Asian Island Peoples</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>	“Like jewels upon the sea,*” thousands of islands spread from the Malay Peninsula through the Pacific to form a vast archipelago encompassing the modern nations of Indonesia and the Philippines and many other small states and territories. Islands on the western edge of this archipelago, including the large islands of Sumatra and Java, were once connected to the peninsula and the rest of the mainland by land bridges that extended as far as Bali. In 1859 the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, who, in parallel to Darwin, described the importance of natural selection for the origin of species, defined what has come to be known as the Wallace Line. This line, which passes through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok, is the boundary between the fauna that had their origins on the continent and fauna more related to those of Australia. </p>

<p>Aboriginal peoples first migrated into the Pacific islands and Australia, either directly from Africa, or from Africa through Asia, approximately 50,000 years ago. These people remained the primary inhabitants of Australia and some of the neighboring islands like New Zealand and New Guinea up until the time of the European intrusions. Traces of these ancient peoples, sometimes referred to as Australoid, are found in the genetic makeup of other tribal peoples on some of the islands, especially deep-jungle tribes such as the Dayaks of Borneo. However, by the beginning of the Common Era, the ethnicity of the dominant people on most of the islands of archipelago had changed due to later migrations from the mainland. The western islands were strongly influenced by migrations of Hindu peoples of India, with Hindu worship and/or Buddhism becoming integrated into, or supplanting earlier animistic faiths. These influences from India were far less significant in the eastern archipelago. The Chinese also traveled into the archipelago since ancient times but mainly for trade, establishing ethnic minority communities on some of the islands primarily in more recent history.</p>

<p>By the 9th century the faiths from India dominated islands like Java. Borobudur, isolated in the forests of central Java, is the largest Buddhist shrine in the world. It was built by the Shailendra dynasty that ruled the Medang Kingdom of Central Java. The Hindu rivals of the Medang kingdom, the Sanjaya kings of the Mataram Kingdom, built their own enormous temple complex at Prambanan in eastern Java. The Medang kings eventually prevailed over the Mataram, but the Hindu gods and Buddhism in the Indonesian world both amalgamated into a unique culture of the islands and remained in the mix, along with even older spirits, even after the coming of Islam. Prior to the 19th century, both Borobudur and Prambanan were largely unknown to the Europeans who visited the islands, but were doubtless a secreted part of the self-identity of the people of Java. </p>

<p>Islam came to islands of the South Pacific in the 13th century. By the time Europeans first came to the islands in the 16th century, Islam was widely accepted, especially by merchants and local rulers. Tribal chiefs had become sultans, sometimes of domains spread over multiple islands, or on larger islands in competition with other local sultans. It is likely that Magellan met his fate at the hands of natives who were Islamic. Islam was most common in the costal communities, while Hindu, Buddhist or animistic faiths held on it the mountainous interior regions of large islands like Java, and importantly in Borneo, as well as in some of the eastern islands. Bali at the southern end of the original land bridge remains predominantly Hindu to the present day. </p>

<p>There are legends of nine holy patriarchs (the Wali Sanga), credited with spreading Islam through Indonesia. However, most historians believe that Islam came to the islands through merchants and immigrants who formed ethnic communities whose influence subsequently spread through the larger population. Once leaders converted, nations converted, at least officially. Prior to the resurrection of militant Islam in the 20th century, Islam in the Pacific Islands was generally not so strict as the practice in Arabia, so that, as in Persia and in India, it became integrated into the cultures rather than dominating them entirely. The Wayang puppet theaters throughout Islamic Indonesia still portray ancient folklore largely predating even the introduction of Hinduism, although the story lines borrow from Hindu epic literature. </p>

<p>	Shortly after 1500, European explorers, and subsequently merchants, made their way to South Asia, establishing trading colonies in India, Malaysia, and the East Indies. The Portuguese were first to establish colonies, followed shortly by the Dutch. They came for spices and other resources. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was granted a charter in 1603 to wage war, build fortresses, and basically do any thing else necessary to establish a monopoly on goods such as nutmeg, peppers, cloves, and cinnamon. Subsequently, as they acquired territory, they also established plantations to grow various cash crops such as coffee, tea, sugar, and rubber. The company’s capitol city was Batavia on the island of Java, the site of modern Jakarta. The city thrived for a hundred years but was rather in decay by 1800 as the old mercantile monopolies began to fail. The Dutch tried to improve the colony, building roads and making small attempts to improve the lot for the native citizens. Throughout the era of Dutch dominion, power in most localities was delegated to local nobility who retained the trappings of the Sultans of old. For the most part, the Dutch brought in relatively few settlers or missionaries, so much of the native Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and tribal cultures survived, at least until the 20th century when cheap consumer goods and modern media changed people’s lifestyles and the pressure of civilization was put on the old headhunter tribes. </p>

<p>The sphere of Dutch influence defines what was ultimately to become the nation of Indonesia. There are over 17,000 islands of Indonesia, but only about half even have a recognized names and less than 1,000 have permanent settlements.</p>

<p>	The Philippines were the second major enclave of European influence in the East Indies, constituting approximately one sixth the land mass of Indonesia, but with about half as large a population, resulting in much higher average population density. The Philippines consist of more than 7,000 islands in three main groups, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Spain’s claim on the islands was the result of Magellan’s voyage and subsequent expeditions sent between 1525 and 1542. In 1570, the Spanish established a capital at Manila for the colony, named after their king, Phillip. Unlike the Dutch in Indonesia, the Spanish established a substantial European population in the Philippines, although always a minority. The Spanish were also active at introducing and supporting Christian (Catholic) missionaries. As a result, modern day Philippines is approximately 80 percent Catholic and only 10 percent Islamic. In contrast, Indonesia is 87 percent Islamic and only about 10 percent Christian (mostly Protestant). </p>

<p>	While the islands were primarily exploited (“colonized”) by the Portuguese, Dutch, and Spanish, British colonial domains centered on the mainland, including the Malay Peninsula and neighboring islands, including eventually, Singapore. However, the British took advantage of the political situation during the Napoleonic wars to invade Java and, for a time, make it part of the British Empire. By 1810, Holland had been conquered by the French and the Dutch were compelled to send pro-French administrators to the Islands. This gave the British reason enough to displace the Dutch and set up their own government in Batavia, led by the somewhat controversial character of Stamford Raffles. Raffle’s administration, with strong military leadership provided by General Rollo Gillespie, changed the balance of power on the islands between the local sultans and the European overlords, very much in favor of the latter. They conducted successful military campaigns against Sultan of Palembang in Sumatra, and Mataram Sultanate based at Yogyakarta and Surakarta. The British also annexed the territories of other minor local rulers and changed the income structure from a crop-based state monopoly to a cash-based tax system. After the final defeat of the French in Europe and the Holland’s subsequent independence, the British ceded back the colonies to the Dutch in 1815. The changes instituted by the British probably were of significant benefit to the Dutch, since they colony they surrendered in 1810 had been well past its prime. The original East India Company (V.O.C.) had in fact been disbanded in 1800 and the territories were reorganized as the Dutch East Indies under control of the Dutch crown. In the century following the departure of the British in 1815, the territories of the colony were expanded substantially.</p>

<p>	There are estimated to be more than 300 different ethnic groups in Indonesia and more than a dozen in the Philippines, not counting Europeans and ethnic Chinese. Despite this diversity, two modern nations emerged more or less as defined by the dimensions of the old colonial dominions. The path to nation state was eased for the Philippines by the defeat of Spain in the Spanish American war of 1898, which led to the American acquisition of the territory. The U.S. had no real colonial aspirations, so from the beginning of the 20th century, America ostensibly supported the country’s path to independence, although over what timetable is not entirely clear. If not for the events of World War II, the Philippines might have been relegated to the same limbo status held by Puerto Rico in the present day, neither a state of the Union nor an independent nation. In Indonesia, the future leader of the nascent state, Sukarno, was already pushing for independence before World War II and suffering for it at the hands of the Dutch. Japanese occupation during the war accelerated the postwar path to independence for Indonesia and the Philippines. It was the Japanese policy in their occupied territories to encourage the native populations to reject the European overlords in favor of nominal independence in a Japanese-led Pan-Asian coalition. In Indonesia, as in Vietnam and Burma, the concept of such “independence” under the Japanese united the nation in preparation for a real war of independence against the former colonial powers. When the Europeans returned after the war to take what they felt as still their rightful positions of power they discovered how much things had changed. Two days after the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Sukarno declared Indonesia’s independence, which was only accepted by the Dutch after four years of war. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines were recognized by the United States as independent.</p>

<p>	For the most part, the items in this chapter come from islands that are now part of either Indonesia or the Philippines, but as discussed above, these national identities are really consequences of modern history. The real stories of these weapons come from the centuries before and the cultural identities of the diverse peoples who preceded the Europeans. Some of these peoples survived the Europeans and the rest of the modern world, and some have not. Even the members of formerly headhunting Dayak tribes on Borneo are now likely to be found wearing modern T-shirts and sneakers, living in cheap government subsidized houses on their progressively more deforested island. Most of their old swords are in museums or curio shops, but a few are surely closeted away. Some of the sword types evolved for duel functions, as weapons and agricultural tools and so may still be seen used as machetes in the rice fields and forests. Other pieces are cultural mementos, sometimes highly venerated by the descendants of the original owners. Among these cultural icons, the <a href="keris/index.html">Keris</a> holds a special position. On the occasions when Western garb is put aside for ceremonial appearances in national costume, an heirloom keris is likely to be a featured part of the man’s apparel. </p>

<p>	Enjoy the items in this chapter as they take you to places that are a complex mix of exotic characters and influences, lands of rainforest, typhoons, betel nut, and headhunters. </p>
