<div class="text">
<p> The Kalinga are one of several Igorot, or Cordilleran Austronesian tribes living in the central highlands of Luzon, the large northern island of the Philippine chain. Headhunting was a sacred practice for several of these tribes but the name, Kalinga, that is sometimes translated as "headhunter," is the name most often associated with this style of axe. The most important purpose for this type of weapon was for decapitation. As suggested by the first photo, which was scavenged from the internet, an Igorot warrior would typically rely on spears for their primary weapons. The characteristic shield of the Kalinga had three prongs on the top and two on the bottom. It has been suggested that the fork between the lower prongs could have been used to pin down the neck of a prostrate opponent to facilitate the act of decapitation.</p>

<p>The Kalinga axes in particular are characterized by the shape of the handle, and this specific blade shape with the long rear projection. It is sometimes suggested that, as is often the case with native weapons, the axes were also used as a multipurpose cutting tools. The long spike could have been driven into earth or soft wood to hold the blade in a fixed position for making draw cuts or similar purposes. It has also been suggested that the spike served to pick up severed heads and transport them home with the axe riding on the warrior's shoulder.</p>

<p>When a warrior proved himself in the taking of a head he would display his status with tattoos, usually across his chest. Women in the tribes would also display tattoos, but only on their arms. The inlays on the handle of this axe are symbolic of the tattoos a warrior would receive after putting an axe to its intended use.</p>

<p>Many of the Philippine people were converted to Catholicism under the Spanish, but as was the case elsewhere in the archipelago, the isolated headhunting tribes of Luzon held onto their animistic beliefs well into the 20th century. However, in the early decades of the 20th century the American administrators, with the help of Protestant missionaries were able to suppress the ancient practices.</p>

<p>The last picture was the front piece of <i>Life or Death in Luzon Thirty Years of Adventure with the Philippine Highlanders</i> (later retitled, <i>Thirty Years with the Philippine Head-Hunters</i>), written around 1932 by Samuel Kane. Kane went to the Philippines in the late 1890s as part of the U.S. Army deployed to put down the Philippine rebellion that had begun during the last years of the Spanish rule.  Kane's first contact with headhunters occurred when a straggler of his patrol was taken by a native spear and left headless on the trail. Kane later made friends with several of the native chiefs and decided to stay on the islands to prospect for gold after he was discharged. Kane and two his friends who shared the gold fever never struck it rich, or even close. However, Kane's relationship with the natives allowed them to live in relative comfort and to survive amongst the headhunters. Their survival was in large part due to their occasional willingness to use their rifles and revolvers on behalf of their host tribe in conflicts with neighboring tribes that won heads for the host village.</p>

<p>Kane ultimately made his fortune not in gold but in flesh. He brokered sales between the U.S. Army and the native tribes for the meat needed to keep the soldiers fed. Once he made his fortune he bought a coffee plantation, but rather than live like a grandee he continued to be an intermediary between the tribes and the American administrators, and he himself came to be appointed as a provincial governor. The chiefs were quicker than many of the younger men of the tribes to see the advantage of setting aside the headhunter tradition in favor of the economic and educational advantages of working with the American administrators, so sporadic headhunting persisted well into the 1920s.  Kane's book is an excellent first-person narrative of this transitional period for the highland tribes of Luzon. He frequently mentions the use of head axes like this one, but only in the context of taking heads or dismembering animals for sacrifices.</p>
