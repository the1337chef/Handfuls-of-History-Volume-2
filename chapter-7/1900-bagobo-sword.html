<p id="date">Circa 1900</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Bagobo are one of the last "wild tribes" of the Philippines* to be assimilated. Prior to the coming of the Spanish they resisted the Islamic tribes, known to the Spanish as the <a href="1800-moro-kampilan.html">Moro</a>. They subsequently resisted the Spanish and their Catholic missionaries. Only after the coming of the Americans and their protestant missionaries, did the Bagobo begin to be drawn into the "modern world," and even then, while the coastal villages began to change, the inland tribes held on to their old faith and traditions, which included human sacrifice, well into the early decades of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The Bagobo lived in a world rich with spirits, most of who were malevolent, unless properly appeased by ritual and sacrifice. These spirits included those of their ancestors and the recently dead. The most recently dead were also the most in need of appeasement in the form of sacrifice to turn their malevolence into spirits of protection from the other supernatural beings. The world of spirits was the special concern of the "Mabalians" the Bagobo shamans and who performed ceremonies and interpreted omens.</p>

<p>The chief god feared by the Bagobo was Eugpamolak Manobo, also called Manama. Many lesser spirits haunted the Bagobo world but there were two deities of special importance to the warriors of the tribe who needed constant appeasement if the tribe was to remain safe from their enemies. These were the powerful spirits, Mandarangan and his wife, Darago, who were believed to make their home in a volcano.</p>

<p>Indeed, warriors were most important people amongst the Bagobo, and highest among warriors was the Datu (chief). Young warriors strived to attain the rank of magani, which was granted to men who had killed an enemy in battle. A single kill entitled a warrior to wear a brown kerchief. The most respected magani were those who had killed six or more people and they were entitled to wear distinctive red clothing. Of course, the magni did not kill indiscriminately, the victims were presumably enemies of the tribe or outlaws. Additionally, if a man were to kill an unfaithful wife and her lover, these deaths could count toward the tally of six. However, to kill just the adulterous wife was not sufficient, unless her lover was also killed by the magani.</p>

<p>Cole places the Bagobo on the eastern coast and uplands of southern Mindanao. Modern sources estimate the current number of Bagobo people at 61,000. Historically, neither the Bagobo houses, nor their villages were intended to be permanent. The tribe practiced "slash and burn agriculture," which involved cutting down forest and burning the cut vegetation once it dried sufficiently. The ash of the fires fertilized the new fields that were cleared, so they could be planted successfully for several years. The chief food of the Bagobo is rice, but their cultivation of it is not the "wet rice" sort, which requires terracing and a sophisticated irrigation system. The Bagobo also cultivated camote (sweet potato), as well as corn, banana, sago, and coconut. They domesticated pigs and chickens, but would eat pretty much anything the forests could provide.</p>

<p>Bagobo houses were simple raised huts of wood, bamboo, and thatch. The roofs overhung the single rooms with open eves, so that smoke from the interior stone hearths would be drawn out. When a house fell into disrepair, or the owner died, it would simply be abandoned. Likewise, if the plots cleared for the crops began to fail, the entire village would be abandoned and the group would move on to a new location. Living as they did in such impermanent dwellings, the Bagobo did not decorate their houses or create works of art to be displayed in them. Rather, the Bagobo decorated themselves, their apparel, and items of daily use, such as the boxes for storing betel nut.</p>

<p><a href="../chapter-5/1800-1900-betel-nuts-and-cutters.html">Betel</a> (areca) nut was important to both the daily life and the religious practices of the Bagobo.  Betel use itself is known to lead to poor oral hygiene and stained teeth and gums. However, the Bagobo would take this to another level with a ceremonial filing of the teeth for members of the tribe when they reached puberty. The teeth would be cut down to stubs and then stained black, all with the feeling that this achieved an ideal of personal beauty.</p>

<p>The most notorious of the Bagobo practices was that of human sacrifice, required to appease the gods (Mandarangan and Darago in particular) and the spirits of the recently dead. It is likely that in their earlier history the passing of a famous Datu would have called for multiple human sacrifices to be made. However, in the period reported by Cole and Benedict, it was the custom to let a single annual ceremonial sacrifice serve to expiate a full year of ills. The ceremony was held each year in late December, when the constellation known to the Bagobo as Balatik ("pig trap"), and to us as Orion, appeared in the sky. The Datu would organize the ceremony and enlist any others who were in need of special release from bad spirits, such as recent widows, to participate and help defray the expense. In the accounts of Cole and Benedict the principle expense was the purchase of a slave to be the sacrificial victim. Typically, the victim was described as a "decrepit" slave, of little value due to age or infirmity.  The slave to be offered would be tied to a tree and the participants with special interest would each have a grip on the spear that was thrust through the body from under an armpit. Death was, essentially, instant.</p>

<p>Benedict suggests that originally the victim of the sacrifice was prisoner captured from a rival tribe and that the substitution of a slave was only a recent modification, after colonial efforts were made for the general pacification of the tribes. Cole mentions that he saw heads brought into the village as recent trophies of a battle, no doubt to validate the status of the warrior who won them. However, neither of the anthropologists describes the Bagobo as true headhunters like the <a href="1920-kalinga-head-axe.html">Kalinga</a> of Luzon or the <a href="1890-dayak-mandau.html">Dayak</a> of Borneo. Likewise, there is no report that the Bagobo were cannibals. Nonetheless, the corpse of the sacrificial victim was subjected to ritual mutilation. Following the death stroke, the presiding Datu would attempt the cut the body in two at the waist with a single stroke of his fighting sword. If unsuccessful, other magani would attempt the feat. The body would then be further cut to pieces, with portions allotted to members of the tribe to be placed on graves or shrine to appease the angriest spirits.</p>

<p>In his plate XXXII, Cole shows four Bagobo fighting swords like those that would have been used in sacrifice ceremony, or for fighting tribal wars. The top and bottom most swords in the picture are quite similar to this example in the shapes of the hilt and the blade, and even to the decorative chains. The two other examples might be classified as <a href="1800-moro-kampilan.html">kampilans</a>, like those used by the Moro. The scabbard of this sword is not as old as the sword itself, and although decorated with colored braided cloths, typical of the Bagobo, it is not as ornate as the older examples shown in Cole's book. Although the Bagobo did not forge their own steel, they were known for casting bronze, so the brass ornament on this scabbard might have come from the original sheath.</p>

<p>* There are two fairly comprehensive books on the Bagobo, written around 1912. They account the experiences of the anthropologists, Fay-Cooper Cole, and Laura Estelle Watson Benedict. Both books are available for download on the internet.</p>
