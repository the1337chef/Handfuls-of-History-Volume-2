<p id="date">Circa 400 BCE (or not)</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The invention of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, marked mankind's departure from the Stone Age. Of course, one of the first things that human beings (such as they are) did with the new material was to make weapons and armor, ultimately of the refined sorts described in the Iliad of Homer. The beginning of the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia dates from about 3500-3200 years BCE (before the common era). Bronze is still used today, and even after the development of iron, bronze was often used for weapons, either because iron was in short supply or because weapons made of good quality bronze were better than ones made of poor quality iron.</p>

<p>This bronze sword was purchased from what I thought was a reputable gallery, and it came with the certificate of authentication shown. There are problems: first off with the attribution of the sword's origin as Greek, from Syria in 400 BCE. At that time, Syria was part of the Persian Empire, but in 333 BCE it became part of Alexander the Great's Empire, and later, part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. Well, close enough-off by 100 years, except that the style of the sword is not really Greek. It does, however, resemble swords of that era from China. 400 BCE was during the Warring States period in Chinese history that ended with the consolidation of the first Chinese Empire under the Qin Dynasty. Many men were under arms in China at that time, many of their weapons were bronze, and bronze weapons survive better than iron ones do, which, unless carefully cared for, will rust away to nothing. So, this sword is surely bronze, possibly ancient, but more likely from China than from Greece or Syria.</p>

<p>Simply searching for "Chinese Bronze Sword" on eBay can put any question about whether this sword came from China aside. You will be impressed with how many "authentic ancient swords" from the Warring States period are available for sale, many of which are similar to this one. Most of these swords are available at remarkably low prices. The eBay swords often have a more even patina and lighter encrustation than this sword does, but I'm sure that each of the eBay vendors will be happy to provide a certificate of authentication. Strike two on the Sadigh Gallery: start to type "Sadigh Gallery" into Google, and the auto-complete function will suggest "Sadigh Gallery fake" amongst the top three choices. Following the subsequent links suggests that while not everything the Sadigh Gallery sells is fake, there have been plenty of complaints. Strike three? Probably.</p>

<p>So, what we have to include in this chapter on edged weapons is a Chinese bronze sword that is at least in the style of the weapons of China 2400 years ago. You may judge for yourself if the patina convinces you of its reputed antiquity. I provide a few pictures of the Scythian bronze <a href="-380-bronze-arrowhead.html">arrowhead</a> also dated to 400 BCE, obtained from a highly reputable dealer in Israel, for comparison.</p>
