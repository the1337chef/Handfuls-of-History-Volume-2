<h1>Chapter 1. Bronze Weapons</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>The first metal to be invented that was really effective for swords and armor was bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. It was malleable and could take an edge that would hold up for a fight or two. If dulled or deformed, it could be sharpened or reshaped. </p>

<p>The Bronze Age is almost synonymous with the Age of Heroes. Stories like the Iliad and the Odyssey came out of the Bronze Age, as well as most tales of Greek heroes like Theseus and Jason. Although the stories took form as epic poetry, they survived to become pre-history turned history, defining the Greek people. There are parallels in other cultures, like the Hindus of India, the Egyptians, and the Pre-Han Chinese. In many cases the makers of iron weapons conquered the Bronze Age peoples (the Dorian Greeks, the Hittites in Mesopotamia, the Han Chinese), but the legends of the Bronze Age endured. Ironically, although bronze weapons were a poor match against ones of iron, over the ages bronze endures, sealed by a patina of corrosion, while iron can rust away to nothing. </p>

<p>Although iron weapons were introduced around 900 BCE, iron remained somewhat scarce compared to bronze for several centuries. The first Emperor of China could not provide his entire army with iron swords, nor could the rival he conquered. Likewise, soldiers of the armies fighting in Mesopotamia at the time of Alexander the Great would carry iron swords and would tip their arrows with bronze. </p>
