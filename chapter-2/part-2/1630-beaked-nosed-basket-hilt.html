<p id="date">Circa 1630</p>

<div class="text">
<p> While the enduring legend of William Wallace has made the two-handed great sword perhaps the most iconic of Scottish weapons, arguably in truth that distinction should go to the basket-hilted broadsword which has been associated with Scotland from the early 1600s to the present day. "Claymore" is a term associated with both the Wallace era great sword and the later basket-hilted swords. Many people will insist that the term claymore should be applied only to the Wallace era great swords. However, Harvey J.S. Withers in his book, <i>The Scottish Sword 1600-1945: An Illustrated History</i>, takes the opposite view based on his translation of the original Gaelic. He claims that the word for the two-handed sword transliterates to something other than claymore and that the association of those swords with that term does not appear until the late 1700s. He maintains that based on common usage, the term claymore is more appropriately applied to the Scottish broadswords.</p>

<p>The first identifiably Scottish broadswords date to the early 1600s. They are similar to, but different from, English and other broadswords of the era, especially in regard to the design of the hilt, which in the case of the Scottish swords, continued to evolve over the next two hundred years. However, after about 1750, the Scots who carried these iconic swords did so in service to the British crown.</p>

<p>From almost immediately after the Norman conquest of England, periodic wars raged between England and Scotland, with England sometimes nearly reducing Scotland to the level of a vassal state to the British crown, and on other occasions, Scotland giving back as good as it took, sending armies deep into England. A section of the Scottish lowlands is still known as the "Borders," commemorating the centuries of back and forth conquest when the English were often in possession of many of the castles in the area, sometimes even the royal castles at Sterling and Edinburgh. After the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the Stewart monarchs of Scotland became also monarchs of England, but the kingdoms were far from unified, and in fact over the next century each was ravaged by their own civil wars. The Acts of Union, which established the United Kingdom, passed only in 1707, more than 100 years after the shared crowns. Anne, daughter of the deposed James II, became the first Queen of Great Britain, and the Scottish monarchy was officially ended. However, the Jacobites, supporters of other Stewart pretenders to the throne of Scotland, made trouble in Scotland for another forty years until the armies raised by "Bonny Prince Charles" were well and truly crushed at the Battle of Culloden on April 16, 1746. The English victory at Culloden was followed by an era of brutal suppression of the Highland Clans. The wearing of kilts and the carrying of swords in Scotland was outlawed for many years. Of course, exceptions were made for the Scots who enlisted in one of the Highland regiments, which from that time to the present have served with distinction in the British Army. While commerce, industry, and education improved life in Scottish cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh, life remained difficult in the Highlands, especially after the late 1700s when landlords, many of them English, enacted a policy of forced displacement of tenant farmers. This became known as the "clearing of the Highlands." It encouraged emigration and led to depopulation of the Highlands that is evident even today. Under such conditions, enlistment into the Highland regiments became an attractive option for Highland men. Men enlisting in the regiments were guaranteed a livelihood and allowed to preserve their Scottish identity, so that kilts, bagpipes, and broadswords were respected and recognized world-wide. Traditional <a href="1870-scottish-regimental-dirk.html">Highland dirks</a> and <a href="1915-scottish-regimental-sgian-dubh.html">sgian-dubh</a> daggers were also preserved in the regiments.</p>

<p>A broadsword is typically a single-handed weapon with a double-edged blade that can be used to either cut or thrust. Its weight commends it more for the latter than the former use. The Schiavona was an earlier Italian broadsword that was popular in Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. It had a distinctive "cat's-head pommel" and hand-guard that was attached to the cross-bar but not to the pommel. The British "mortuary sword" was a more direct antecedent of the Scottish broadswords, differing mainly by having a more open hilt than the Scottish swords of the same era.</p>

<p>The "beak-nose," basket-hilted swords like this one are the earliest type of broadswords recognized as distinctly Scottish. The basket of the hilt is formed primarily of a single flattened, folded plate. The hilts of later swords are formed with multiple rounded bars and decorative plates. The one round bar at the mouth of the basket of this sword is likely to have been added later. Several tips of the plate that forms the basket are folded and welded together to create what has been called a "beak nose," giving this type of sword its name. The grip is wire-wrapped fish skin and appears old and original. The basket almost certainly would have had a liner of leather and cloth. There is a maker's mark I cannot identify.</p>

<p>This style of sword dates from 1600 to 1650, when the same kings held both English and Scottish crowns, albeit tenuously. Charles I, the second Stewart king of England, lost both his crowns and his head in 1649 to the Parliamentarians of Oliver Cromwell. His son, Charles II, was declared King in Scotland, but even in Scotland his control was shaky because of the power wielded by the party of the Scottish Kirk. Cromwell's armies invaded Scotland and defeated the Scottish at the Battle of Worcester on September 3, 1651. Charles II was forced into exile for nine years until the political vacuum created by the death of Cromwell led to his recall and the restoration of the joint monarchy in 1661. This sword has assuredly come through interesting times. The blade is sturdy and has seen use. Although it dates to after the time of the border wars, it certainly would have been used during the era of the English civil wars, and when supporters of the exiled Charles II were fighting the Scottish protestant extremist Covenanters. It also comes from a time when warfare between the clans was still common. A serviceable sword, it might have been carried right up until the time of Culloden and then hidden away as a family's connection to their heritage. It is not a sword that would have been carried in service to the British crown.</p>
