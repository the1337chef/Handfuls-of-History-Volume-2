<p id="date">Circa 1863</p>

<div class="text">
<p> It is never the plan that high ranking officers should have to engage the enemy hand-to-hand, but likewise they should not be unprepared should the need arise. In the ages before firearms, officers in extreme duress would have to rely on swords or other edged weapons just like the men in their command. By the 18th century, while the common soldiers carried muskets with bayonets for close quarters, officers were more likely to have a pistol and a sword. The sword distinguished the officer and so became a symbol of his authority. When the U.S. Army released a new pattern for a sword to be carried by Staff and Field officers in 1850, the standard army pistol was single-shot with a percussion lock. If needed, the 1850 Staff and Field Officer's Sword could hold its own as a weapon if the single shot from the officer's pistol proved insufficient defense.</p>

<p>Staff and Field Officers held the rank of Major or higher, and becoming of their rank, the sword designated for them was both serviceable and elegant. They were produced by numerous firms in the U.S. and abroad, with many coming from Germany. They had certain stipulated features such as a nearly straight blade of a certain length and width, etched patriotic images along the length of the blade, and a wire-wrapped ray-skin grip. The hilts were brass with "US" standing out in the embellishments. They were intended to be serviceable weapons once sharpened.</p>

<p>The concept that a senior officer should need such a serviceable sword was relaxed in 1860 when the Army issued the pattern for the <a href="1890-us-field-and-staff-officers-sword.html">1860 Staff and Field Officer's sword</a>, which was more of a costume accessory than a weapon. Of course, by 1860 single-shot pistols had almost universally been replaced by revolvers like the Colt Navy and Army models, further diminishing the likelihood for a sword to be used in anger by an infantry officer. However, with the Civil War raging, the army would have had little luck persuading all officers to replace a serviceable sword like the 1850 pattern for a rather foppish model like the 1860 pattern. The choice of swords for Staff and Field Officers was optional between the 1850 and 1860 patterns until 1872 when the 1860 pattern was specified for all army officers with a few exceptions in specialized services. The switch to an officer's sword with more symbolic than practical value was not universally popular, and in 1902 the Uniform Regulations specified a new <a href="1920-us-model-1902-army-officers-sword.html">Officer's Saber</a> that remains the regulation sword to this day. The 1902 Officer's sword has at least the appearance of a proper saber, but in fact its use is mostly ceremonial and usually the blades are not sharpened.</p>

<p>This sword is in nice condition although the etching is faded, hard to see, and harder still to photograph. No marks indicating the maker are visible. It came with a replacement scabbard, which is only featured in a single photograph. There is also a set of pictures comparing it to the 1860 and 1902 patterns. It is almost a certainty that this sword was carried by a Union officer in the American Civil War, but it is hard to date it with much precision based on the object alone. As discussed above, swords like this were in use from 1850 to 1872.</p>

<p>This sword however did come with an oral tradition regarding its original owner. It was purchased from Dave Nelson who has a Civil War antiquities business in Jacksonville, Florida, which has been the source of numerous pieces in this collection from that era. Dave reports, "The sword was presented to me as the sword belonging to the seller after being passed down through the family. His desire to sell was greater than the ownership of a family heirloom. He did not know the first name. He knew only the last name Clapp (which was not his), his rank upon discharge (Major) and the state of residence was Massachusetts."</p>

<p>I suppose we might discount a detail or two, like the association with Massachusetts. Unfortunately, my queries on the internet led only to the following dead ends:</p>

<p>Captain Alonzo H. Clapp of the 122nd New York Infantry Regiment was promoted to Major with rank to October 24, 1864. However, Major Clapp died in the Second Division, Sixth Corps Hospital June 23, 1865.</p>

<p>There was a John B. Clapp from Vermont who ultimately achieved the rank of General.</p>

<p>Henry Austin Clapp was born July 17, 1841, the eldest child of John Pierce Clapp, of Dorchester, Massachusetts. On August 12, 1862, halfway through his law studies, Henry Clapp sent a letter to the officers of the Harvard Corporation, informing them that he resigned his place as proctor, having enlisted with the nine-months men in the New England Guards Regiment, Formation of the Forty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. I was not able to discover what rank he achieved, but the reference indicated that he had no surviving children and "... Henry Clapp's line thus became extinct."</p>

<p>However, Dave Nelson did a little research on his own through Historical Data Systems which brought up Channing Clapp from Boston, who at the age of 26 enlisted on December 19, 1861 as a First Lieutenant into Company D of the Massachusetts 1st Cavalry. On May 8, 1863, he was commissioned into the U.S. Volunteers Adjutant General's Department as an Assistant Adjutant General, and he held the rank of Major when he resigned his commission on June 21, 1865, two months after Lee's surrender.</p>

<p>The Internet yielded further information on Major Channing Clapp. He was born September 26, 1835, in Leicester, Worcester County, Massachusetts. He was the son of Joshua Clapp and Lucia Denny Clapp (1808-1895) and he married Susan P. Sohier Clapp (1839-1917). He died May 13, 1904, in Boston, Massachusetts. As Assistant Adjutant General, he is credited with several entries into the Congressional record.</p>

<p>Another website claimed "Channing Clapp and his partner Henry Lee Higginson built one of the largest cotton plantations in the South." Which seemed odd for a Bostonian, however what the website had to sell was a reproduction of a bond signed by Channing Clapp dated BOSTON, June 1, 1878, and issued by the Merchants National Bank. Clapp signs for the treasurer of the Lawrence Manufacturing Company, which makes him a businessman, and seems like a reasonable occupation for a retired Assistant Adjutant General. The Lawrence Manufacturing Company was a textile firm based in Lowell, Massachusetts, which became a division of the Ames Textile Corp. Of course the connection to plantation building might have come through the investment of the Lawrence Manufacturing Company in old cotton producing property available cheap in the South during the reconstruction.</p>

<p>It would not be a difficult stretch of credulity to hypothesize that this was the sword of Major Channing Clapp.</p>
