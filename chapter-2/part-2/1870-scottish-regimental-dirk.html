<p id="date">Circa 1870</p>

<div class="text">
<p> For the most part, the business of the world is conducted by men and women in what we consider typical Western garments. However, many people venerate what they would consider the national costume of their people, be it a kimono or a kilt. In some countries, these costumes may only be brought out and worn on special occasion. The Scots in particular seem happy to find such occasions. Moreover, as the Scotts desired to keep their national identity even as they were brought into the United Kingdom, military regiments recruited into the British army from the Highlands adopted uniforms that were based on the Scottish national dress. Indeed, for fifty years after the battle of Culloden in 1746, traditional Scottish dress was outlawed and the only Scotsmen to legally be allowed to wear a kilt were those enlisted in the British army.</p>

<p>Men in kilts have served the British Empire with distinction from the eighteenth century to the present day, achieving special fame in the 1800s in conflicts such as the Crimean war and the Indian mutiny. Soldiers in the highland regiments would carry standard British rifles but would have distinctly Scottish swords and daggers. Along with the traditional <a href="1630-beaked-nosed-basket-hilt.html">basket-hilted broad swords</a>, the Scottish weapons included two types of daggers, the dirk and the smaller <a href="1915-scottish-regimental-sgian-dubh.html">sgian-dubh</a>. While the term dirk might apply to any sort of dagger, it is most often applied to either long, thin knives carried by naval officers or midshipmen, or to the larger of the two daggers associated with the Scots. The Scottish dirk is probably derived from medieval ballock or rondel daggers.</p>

<p>Over the years there have been many different Scottish regiments, each distinguished by their tartans as well as by the fittings of their daggers and other insigna. The pommel and top scabbard mount of this dirk both bear a large 79 for the 79th Regiment, later known as The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. The 1st Battalion 79th Cameron Highlanders was originally raised by Alan Cameron of Errachtin in 1793. It was in 1873 that Her Majesty Queen Victoria, gave them their new title "The 79th Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders" which they carried until the British Army was reorganized in 1881. Although the regiment was kept intact, the 79 was officially dropped from their title making them just the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>Over the centuries the regiment won numerous battle honors. They fought in the Napoleonic Wars, during the Peninsular Campaign and at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Duke of Wellington especially requested their participation in the final series of battles that led to the Battle of Waterloo. The 79th served in almost every corner of the British Empire, as well as serving occasional tours at home in Scotland. They garrisoned in Canada and Gibraltar and fought with distinction in the Crimea and in India where they were dispatched to suppress the mutiny of 1857.</p>

<p>In 1882 the regiment participated in the conquest of Egypt. They remained stationed there until 1886, before further service in Gibraltar, Scotland, and Malta-and then they were called back to Egypt to join Kitchener's forces for the retaking of the Sudan in 1898.</p>

<p>The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders received new colors from Queen Victoria in October of 1898 and were sent back to Egypt and then to South Africa for the Boer war. In 1904 they were granted a brief respite from hard duty, serving as the Royal Guard at Balmoral Castle before being sent to North Ireland for three years. In 1914 the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders marched out of Edinburgh Castle to head to France.</p>

<p>While the attribution of this dagger to an officer of the 79th is clear, it is hard to deduce any more specifics. It must predate the renaming of the regiment in 1881, although if it was in service at that time, it likely remained so until the officer who owned it retired. It may have served at Waterloo, or Alma and Sevastapol in the Crimea or at recapture of Lucknow in India.</p>
