<p id="date">1898</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This is very good, albeit relatively modern, example of the single-most impressive Scottish military edged weapon. Although probably derived from the English backsword, along with the <a href="1870-scottish-regimental-dirk.html">dirk</a> and <a href="1915-scottish-regimental-sgian-dubh.html">sgian dubh</a>, the basket-hilted broad sword has been one of the iconic Scottish weapons since the time of the Stuarts in the 1600s. After the exhalation of the last gasp of Stuart ambition at the battle of Culloden in 1746, the British suppressed Scottish militarism and absentee English landlords began the process known as "the clearing of the Highlands," displacing many of the tenant crofters. Scottish broadswords were banned for the defending of the clans, but were still permitted for enlistees to Highland Regiments who continue to fight for the British crown to the present day.</p>

<p>While the baskets of <a href="1630-beaked-nosed-basket-hilt.html">early basket-hilted swords</a> were shaped from flat bars or ribbons of steel, since the 1700s, the baskets have taken more open forms with round bars and pierced plates. The swords carried by the officers of Highland Regiments today are clearly related to those swords of three hundred years ago. This classic example measures 39.75" overall with a 33" straight, double-edged blade having narrow, unstopped central fullers. There are etched panels over two thirds of the length of the blade, with a typical thistle scrollwork motif framing the "(crown)/HIGHLAND/(hunting horn)/LT./INFANTRY" within the central panel on the reverse.</p>

<p>Further down the forte is an armorial crest (lion, sejant erect holding an orb), a motto: "ESSE QUAM VIDERI" ("To be, rather than seem to be"), and the initials: "HCS." The obverse has a very ornate entwined monogram, the Prince of Wales' crest, and an unmarked ricasso. The blade is proofed with the Wilkinson "HW" mark and has a Wilkinson serial number along the edge (34024), corresponding to the year 1896. The full basket guard and domed pommel are in fine condition. The scarlet felt lining and crimson pommel tassels are very good shape with some minor insect damage, and the shagreen grip, which has an intact and tightly wound braided wire wrap, is also in very good condition.</p>

<p>While some of the Highland regiments have very long histories, others were created or dissolved through the processes of reorganization that occurred over the years. The Highland Light Infantry was formed in 1881 when the 71st Light Infantry and 74th Regiment of Foot were combined with the Militia and Volunteer Rifle units around the city of Glasgow. The regiment did duty in India and then fought in Egypt at Tel-el-Kebir in 1882, before shipping to South Africa for the Second Anglo-Boer War in 1900, winning honors at Modder River. The unit went on to serve with distinction in the First World War, seeing action both at Gallipoli and on the Western front.</p>

<p>In 1959, the Highland Light Infantry was amalgamated with the Royal Scots Fusiliers to become The Royal Highland Fusiliers, also known, as Princess Margaret's own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment. Therefore the Highland light Infantry existed under that name for less than 100 years.</p>

<p>The designation of the light infantry as a Highland regiment is a bit ironic, since they recruited mainly around Glasgow, in the lowlands, but the idea of the Highlands was much of the allure for enlistment and some souls were no doubt disappointed that it was not so Highland after all. One such disappointed soul was the actor Davd Niven, who in 1930 was appointed a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Reportedly, he requested assignment to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders or the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), and then jokingly wrote on the form, as his third choice, "anything but the Highland Light Infantry." At the time the dress uniform of the Highland Light Infantry was specified as tartan trews (trousers), rather than kilts, giving them the appearance of men wearing plaid pajama bottoms. Shortly after his enlistment, Niven deserted his assigned company and took ship for America where he began his acting career. However, after Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Niven returned home and rejoined the British Army.</p>

<p>Until 1947, when kilts were authorized, the Highland Light Infantry was the only regular Highland regiment to wear trews for full dress. At least they were permitted proper highland swords. Of course, by the time this sword was made, the only European military swords still considered to be true weapons were cavalry <a href="1914-french-model-1896-cavalry-saber.html">sabers</a>. The Scottish broadswords had become just symbolic of status, authority, and heritage. The blade of this sword has not been sharpened and the <a href="1630-beaked-nosed-basket-hilt.html">beak-nosed broad sword</a> of 250 years earlier would be by far a more effective weapon.</p>
