<h1>Chapter 2. Europe and the Americas</h1>
<h2>Part 2: European and American Military Knives, Swords, Sabers, and Cutlasses</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>	From before recorded history, humans used weapons that would pound, pierce, or slash. Although sometimes harm was delivered by objects thrown or projected by sling, bow, or later, catapult, commonly, until the age of firearms, warfare culminated in hand-to-hand close-contact melee. The pounding, piercing, and slashing were delivered by a variety of weapons, including maces, war hammers, swords, daggers, and the like. Ultimately, these sorts of weapons were put aside as the age of firearms matured, a process that occurred over the course of several centuries. Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan might have been “Musketeers” (albeit fictional ones) but their fighting renown was for their use of swords, not muskets. Although written in the 1840s, <i>The Three Musketeers</i> was set around 1625 when the muskets would have been of the very cumbersome matchlock type. By the early 1700s most muskets in European armies would be flintlocks and the ordinary infantryman would have a bayonet rather than a sword. Swords remained common though, for officers and special troops, but their role in warfare became progressively more limited. This chapter covers a wide range of European and American military swords, from the formidable <a href="1630-beaked-nosed-basket-hilt.html">Scottish broadsword</a>, to the gracile sword of 20th century non-commissioned officers (<a href="1864-ames-nco-sword.html">union</a> and <a href="1899-german-nco-sword.html">german</a>). It also includes some pieces that were intended more to serve as tools than as weapons. More or less coincident with the perfection of revolver and auto-loading pistol technology, the swords carried by officers in many branches of the military became progressively more symbolic of authority, ornamental rather than functional as weapons. </p>

<p>	Two types of military swords which continued to have military usefulness longer than most, were <a href="1842-french-naval-cutlass.html">naval cutlasses</a> and <a href="1849-us-model-1840-cavalry-saber.html">cavalry sabers</a>. The earliest swords that might fit in the category of sabers were the curved, single-edged blades of lightly armored mounted warriors, such as the Mongol invaders of the 13th century. These weapons, epitomized by the Turkish <a href="../../chapter-4/1780-shamshir.html">shamshir</a>, set a pattern for cavalry weapons up until the 20th century. </p>

<p>While the cavalry saber was one of the few types of swords which retained its importance as a weapon of war well into the age of firearms, by the time of the American Civil War this was due to change. Select mounted forces, like those of Morgan’s raiders, first totally forsook the saber for a brace of revolvers. Of course unlike proper cavalry units, which would face properly armed infantry or other cavalry units, raiders like Morgan’s were as likely to confront civilians. However, the biggest game changer for cavalry during the American Civil War was the development of breech loading carbines and especially repeaters like the Spencer. Even revolvers were not of much use until the moment of melee and close quarter combat, but easily reloaded carbines vastly increased the reach of a cavalry attack. The new carbines also allowed cavalry to function more effectively as mobile mounted infantry, deployed to strategic positions and sometimes able to deliver withering rapid fire on conventional infantry still burdened with single-shot muzzle-loading rifles. </p>

<p>Through the long history of the saber, its basic form changed relatively little. However, in the decades preceding World War I, close to the end of the era for horse-mounted cavalry, the philosophy for saber design and usage changed. While the saber was the edged weapon of choice for most mounted troops, a lance was an alternative armament, going back to the heavy cavalry of medieval knights. British lancers were renowned, as were the Polish Uhlans. The handling of a lance, however, was probably best a two-handed affair, which would not have allowed for free use of even a single revolver. Perhaps this was part of the motivation for a change in saber design. The French switched from sabers with curved blades to ones with straight blades in 1882, although they implemented relatively little change to the hilt design, as can be seen in the <a href="1914-french-model-1896-cavalry-saber.html">Model 1896 officer’s saber</a>. In 1908, the British introduced a new <a href="1916-pattern-1908-british-cavalry-saber.html">saber</a>, which was followed by the <a href="1914-patton-saber.html">U.S. Model 1913 “Patton” saber</a>. These swords had long straight blades and heavy pommels with thumb rests to improve the balance and grip of the hilt, allowing them to be held forward on a rigid arm and used like a lance. This presentation of the weapon was intended for the charge, and presumably, since these weapons were not so well suited for a close-quarters mêlée as the traditional saber, in close quarters these anachronistic mounted warriors could then rely on their revolvers. The design of these late sabers was reminiscent of the earlier estocs, which were basically short spears mounted as swords. Estocs were carried by certain mounted troops, such as Hussars, in scabbards on the saddle, opposite the side of the rider’s saber. The estoc was so long it would take both hands to draw it, and then it would be held forward during a charge, especially when approaching troops in armor. Exclusively a thrusting weapon and often incapable of cutting, the estoc was intended to be able to pierce a breastplate. Once the enemy was engaged, the estoc would be discarded in favor of the saber.</p>

<p>Cutlasses are another class of mêlée sword, not for the battlefield, but for ship-to-ship boarding parties. The design of these weapons also matured over the course of the 19th century. The most iconic form of the cutlass is evident in the <a href="1842-french-naval-cutlass.html">French 1831 Model</a> cutlass. This sword set the pattern that was followed by other nations including the U.S. in their <a href="1862-model-1860-ames-navy-cutlass.html">1861 Model</a>. The earlier U.S. <a href="1842-us-model-1841-navy-cutlass.html">1841 Model cutlass</a> was only slightly modified from the <a href="1850-french-foot-artillery-sword.html">foot artillery sword</a>.</p>

<p>The British Royal Navy officially declared in 1936 that cutlasses would only be used for ceremonial purposes, but in fact there was recorded use of cutlasses by the Royal Navy as late as 1940. Cutlasses remained official weapons of the U.S. Navy until 1949.</p>
