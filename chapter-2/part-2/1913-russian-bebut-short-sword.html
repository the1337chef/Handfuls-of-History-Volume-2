<p id="date">1913</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Prior to 1907, Imperial Russia issued military versions of the <a href="1895-russian-shashka.html">shashka</a> for foot soldiers. These were either styled like western <a href="1900-russian-cavalry-saber.html">sabers</a> with knuckle guards, or were in the style of shashka of <a href="1850-georgian-shashka.html">Georgia</a> and the <a href="../../chapter-4/1850-murid-shashka.html">Caucasus</a>. While sabers remained in service for cavalry units after 1907, infantry and artillery units were switched to the shorter bebut sword. The bebut is often referred to as a kindjal, due to the style of the hilt, both in the shape of the grip and the decorative dome-shaped studs at top and bottom. However, the traditional <a href="../../chapter-4/1870-kindjal.html">kindjals</a> of Georgia have straight double-edged blades and are often beautifully crafted with engraving, inlays and nielloing. The bebut swords in contrast, with curved, usually single-edged blades, plain wooden handles, and leather-covered scabbards, are simply functional with all the signs of mass production for the military. The idea, of course, was that in the new era of bolt-action repeating rifles, soldiers would only need to rely on edged weapons in extreme situations of close quarter combat, so they would be better served with shorter swords. In hindsight, the Bebut was perhaps too much of a compromise toward older swords and in fact foot soldiers might have been better off with just simple combat knives.</p>

<p>This sword was made in 1913, probably at the Zlatoust Arms Factory. It would have been in service during the first three years of the Great War, until the revolution caused Russia to withdraw. In addition to the date stamp and the Arms factory Imperial Russian stamp, there are other marks on the hilt that were likely unit marks, but these are difficult to read. There are additional marks on the blade that are probably inspector's marks. It looks like what may be the initials of one of the former owners are carved on the top of the handle.</p>

<p>One curious thing is that it looks like someone has tried to serrate the blade of this sword on both edges. Was this done to make it a more vicious weapon or perhaps to make it more able to cut brush? The short swords of artillery units often had to be used to clear vegetation for gun emplacements, so that the nickname for the <a href="1850-french-foot-artillery-sword.html">French</a> sword was coupe choux (cabbage cutter). Some units of Prussian advance troops were issued "<a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/bayonets/Individual/1871Mauser0001.JPG">pioneer bayonets</a>" on which the backside was serrated so that it could serve as a saw blade.</p>

<p>It has been well over a hundred years since this sword was made, and for only four of those years was it in standard military service. Russia fought the Great War on multiple fronts-in Europe against the Germans, and in Asia against the Turks. In 1917 many soldiers did not just walk home, rather they joined one side or the other of the Russia Civil War that was beginning. Eventually though, this sword would have made it home with some tired Russian soldier, unless it was picked up as a souvenir by a former enemy.  Because these swords were never used by the Soviets, it is not something that would have been sold off as government surplus, as many American and European weapons were. It is quite possible that it was just used for whatever purpose was at hand and when it dulled, someone chose to serrate the blade to give it a few more years of service.</p>
