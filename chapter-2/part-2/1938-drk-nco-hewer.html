<p id="date">1938</p>

<div class="text">
<p> I have steered myself away from Nazi daggers in the past due to my disgust for what the Nazis represented. As with most military edged weapons of the 20th century, the Nazi swords and daggers are more indicative of status than they were actual weapons. These daggers were tools for the Nazi propaganda machine and their social manipulation. Nonetheless, plenty of other people are willing to spend large amounts of money on them, and therefore the market is full of fakes.</p>

<p>Both the Nazis and the early 20th century (Meiji and Taisho) Japanese Emperors awarded civil swords and daggers to instill patriotic bravado in ordinary civil servants such as railroad conductors or postal workers. When I first came upon this piece, with its seemly purposeful saw blade and non-military blunted point, I thought it was intended to be a actual field hospital tool, not unlike the <a href="1943-usmc-corpsman-knife.html">USMC Corpsman</a> knife, and not a typical bit of Nazi foppery. However, I subsequently learned that it was civil, not military, and issued to a noncommissioned officer in the male division of the German Red Cross.</p>

<p>The German Red Cross was originally a branch of the international Red Cross organization. However, in 1938 Hitler incorporated the German Branch of the Red Cross (Deutsches Rotes Kreuz, DRK) into the numerous social programs controlled by the Nazi party, giving it a paramilitary status not unlike the S.A., but presumably with a mission of social welfare. This reorganization effectively dissociated the DRK from the Geneva-based International Red Cross (IRC). The insignia adopted for the DRK combined the omnipresent Nazi Eagle and swastika with the international symbol for the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Between 1938 and 1940, the DRK recruited to both a men's and a women's division. In February 1938, the DRK Hewer was authorized for daily wear by NCOs in the men's division. They were issued from the stores and no personnel purchases were allowed. The Hewer was discontinued in 1940, although the German Red Cross remained active throughout the war. Although the men's division was not disbanded, after 1940 recruitment shifted heavily in favor of the women's division. Women volunteers were needed as nurses in civilian hospitals as well as state hospitals for wounded soldiers. Men were needed at the battle lines. Presumably, male volunteers signed on prior to 1940 kept their Hewers, and if they could avoid being drafted into the regular army, were allowed to continue functioning on the home front. I suspect that it was mostly elderly or infirm men who were allowed to stay active in the DRK after 1940.</p>

<p>"Hewer" is an interesting term, it usually refers to a miner, one who hews ore from the earth, and apparently the application of the term to this piece was intended to imply that the instrument was a tool rather than a weapon. On this basis, presumably legitimized by the fact that the instrument had a chisel point rather than a sharp dagger-like point, the person carrying a Hewer might be classified a non-combatant and treated appropriately under the Geneva convention. Of course this special distinction would not have applied to a DRK member also equipped with a small Walther or Mauser pistol, which likely would have been the case. Interestingly, the configuration of the Hewer as a putative non-weapon, had another sort of significance, officers in the DRK were issued proper pointed daggers with DRK insignia, which would have classed them with any other member of the Nazi paramilitary in the eyes of the Geneva Convention so that only the rank and file would have been classed as non-military. The rank and file of RAD, Reichs Labour Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst), which was the Nazi equivalent of the CCC, were also issued "Hewers" from 1934 until the RAD was absorbed into the German army in 1940. The RAD Hewer was of similar dimensions to the DRK Hewers but with an antler grip and an ax or machete-like tip.</p>

<p>While the DRK functioned as part of the Nazi machine, there is also a great deal of controversy about the International Red Cross (IRC) itself and their failure to react in a proactive way to the atrocities of the Nazi death camps. Holocaust deniers take the lack of IRC reaction as proof that the Holocaust never occurred, while other sources maintain that the IRC inspectors were only allowed to see an atypical "model camp." Whatever the truth, the IRC did not push the issue and remained silent about the Nazi atrocities. On the other hand, the DRK was complicit with the Nazis programs.</p>

<p>This is an excellent original example of the DRK NCO Hewer. The 10.5" blade has a single sharp edge and is saw toothed on the other side. The saw-tooth edge might have been used for removing plaster casts, preparing splints or even clearing brush. The tip of the blade is correctly squared. The DRK Hewers were produced mainly by Robert Klaas and P.D. Luneschloss but are unmarked. The leather frog on this piece is marked Paul Klopfer, Berlin 1938. Klopfer also made leather field pouches for medical equipment. It is not likely that the men's division of the DRK did any battlefield service. Field hospital duties would have been filled by members of the regular army medical corps. During the war, the DRK would have served on the home front and may have been quite busy as the allies brought the war onto German soil. I suspect however, especially since most of the surviving DRK Hewers are in excellent condition, that after 1940 most of the men who volunteered to serve on the DRK were compelled to put aside their Hewers and take up K98 Mauser rifles.</p>
