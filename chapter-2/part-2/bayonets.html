<div class="text">
<p>	Since bayonets are part of the history of firearms, they have been previously introduced in an earlier volume of this book. The purpose of this entry will be to discuss and illustrate the history of bayonets in a general way, with specific examples related to guns in the collection. Historically, a bayonet was a logical and useful accessory for a military long gun, especially a single-shot muzzle-loader with limited range and accuracy. However, it is believed that bayonets had their origin as accessories to hunting guns, quite likely in Spain sometime in the 16th century. </p>

<p>The earliest bayonets were â<a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-1/1750-german-hunting-sword-plug-bayonet/01.jpg">plug</a>â bayonets, long knives with tapered or bulged handles that could be inserted into the bore of the gun and hopefully held there firmly enough to make the combined weapon of some use as a lance. Imagine a hunter who has injured a large animal but needs to deliver a coup de grÃ¢ce without having time to reload their matchlock or flintlock musket. Their best option, and one familiar from antiquity, would be to spear the beast. Of course, they had best get it right on a single attempt, and woe be the hunter who gets his bayonet stuck and loses it when trying to withdraw it. Plug bayonets sometimes had a cross bar to prevent them being inserted too deeply and thereby getting stuck. </p>

<p>The association between Spain and the origin of plug bayonets is supported by the existence of traditional Spanish daggers that bear a small resemblance to plug bayonets and remained popular up to the twentieth century. The daggers are associated with the city of Albacete, and so knives of this style are known as <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Albecete0001.jpg">Albacete</a> daggers. </p>

<p>Although there was at least limited military use of plug bayonets in the late 1600s, a new and more practical form, the socket bayonet, appeared in the beginning of the 18th century. A socket bayonet is inserted over the muzzle of a rifle or musket and then locked in place by rotating a collar as shown for the bayonet fixed on the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/HallSocket.jpg">Hall rifle</a>. The socket bayonet was almost universally adaptable and remained in common use for two hundred years. More or less traditional socket bayonets were used in World War II on Russian <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/1938Mosin0006.jpg">Mosin-Nagant rifles</a>. Most socket bayonets had long blades strengthened with a rib on the backside, like these for the U.S. <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sockets0001.jpg">1842 smooth-bore musket</a>, the Civil War era rifled muskets, and early <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sockets0002.jpg">1866 trapdoor conversions</a>. Over the years, the most remarkable thing that changed in the U.S. socket bayonets was the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sockets0003.jpg">size</a> of the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sockets0004.jpg">socket</a> <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sockets0005.jpg">itself</a>, which originally had to accommodate .69-caliber muskets, then .58 caliber rifled muskets, and later .45-caliber barrels of the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/1873Trapdoor.jpg">1873 Trapdoor Springfields</a>. These bayonets would have all come with scabbards to protect them, although these have often been lost. They would have also been issued with âfrogs,â leather adaptors that allowed them to attach to a soldierâs belt.</p>

<p>Throughout the era of muzzle-loading muskets, most European armies also relied primarily on socket bayonets. English infantry were renowned for being able to establish square formations, bristling with bayonets that could discourage direct cavalry attacks. The British also âstuckâ with socket bayonets for their single-shot <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Martini0025.jpg">Martini Henry</a> rifles. However, another style of bayonet was introduced in the early 19th century that had a hilt so that it could be wielded like a sword or used as a knife when not attached to a rifle or musket. Some of the first such sword bayonets used in the British Army were issued to the corps of riflemen. The British apparently came to appreciate the strategic value of riflemen when on the losing side of the American Revolution, so in 1801 they supplemented their production of <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/sword.jpg">Brown Bess</a> muskets with small numbers of Baker rifles. Regiments of riflemen were deployed tactically as skirmishers to take key positions where the range and accuracy of the rifles could be best utilized. In the 1830s, the British flintlocks were replaced by percussion cap-lock equivalents. The Baker rifles were replaced by two-groove Brunswick rifles.</p>

<p>Typically, the riflemen might even fall back as the larger battle engaged. Since they were not expected to necessarily join the melee on the open battlefields, it was useful for the riflemen to have a bayonet that would offer more flexible service. Therefore, the early sword bayonets issued to the early corps of British riflemen were a bit different from types that would later issued on a large scale by many armies. The earlier British patterns were relatively broad, two-edged short swords, probably more amenable to hacking than thrusting. They resembled ancient Roman gladius short swords, which were also the pattern for similar swords issued to <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/swords.jpg">artillery</a> units beginning in the Napoleonic era. The French nicknamed such swords âcabbage choppers.â They were probably used as much as machetes, clearing brush for the placement of cannon batteries, as they were used as weapons. It seems likely that British riflemen trying to ensconce themselves on a wooded hillside might have found a similar use for their sword bayonets. </p>

<p>The French adopted sword bayonets when they switched from muzzle-loaders to breech-loading rifles. The <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Chassepot0001.jpg">Chassepot</a> needlefire rifleâs bayonet was a true saber, but over the years the French bayonets became <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/French0001.jpg">progressively stylized</a>. The <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Gras0001.jpg">Gras</a> bayonet introduced in 1874 retained a single edge along its length with a reinforcing T-back on the other side. The bayonets for the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Lebel0002.jpg">1886 Lebel rifles</a>, while retaining a handle, were essentially cruciform spikes. </p>

<p>Most bayonets issued with rifles used in the 20th century had more knife-like than sword-like appearance. However, typical bayonets of the World War I era, for example the bayonets of U.S. <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Krag0026.jpg">Krag-JÃ¸rgensen</a>, <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/03SpringFld0002.jpg">1903 Springfield</a>, and <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Eddystone0048.jpg">1917 Eddystone</a>, the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/ArgentineBay0001.jpg">Argentine 1891 Mauser</a>, the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/CarcBay0004.jpg">Italian 1891 Carcano</a>, and the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Type38Jap0001.jpg">Japanese Model 38</a> rifles had very long blades. The concept was that should two opponents have to more or less fence with their rifle-mounted bayonets, the longer the bayonet, the greater the reach and advantage of the combined weapon. One exception to the trend for older knife bayonets to be rather elongated was the bayonets used on <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/SwedishSemi0024.jpg">Swedish Mausers</a>. The same style bayonets were still used on the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/SwedishSemi0024.jpg">Swedish semi-automatic rifles</a> of the 1940s. The bayonets intended for Canadian-made <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Ross0047.jpg">Ross rifles</a> were also relatively short [Ross0047.jpg]. However, when the Ross rifles were found unacceptable for trench warfare and recalled, it left a large numbers of bayonets without rifles to use them on. For that reason it is not uncommon to find a Ross bayonet converted to a simple âfighting knifeâ by removal of the latching mechanism. The conversions were most likely done when the bayonets were sold off as surplus.</p>

<p>The system for attaching a knife bayonet was similar for most rifles, as illustrated in this picture of the bayonet mounted to a <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/CarcMounting.jpg">Carcano rifle</a>. The cross guard of the handle would have a hole to fit over the barrel, and there were lugs on the forward barrel band or nosepiece that would match a slot in the base of the knife handle, with a latching mechanism to hold the two together. The World War I era <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/SMLE_peg0001.jpg">British Mark III SMLE</a> rifles, however, had wooden stocks that went all the way to the end of the barrel. Therefore the ring on the bayonet handle fit a peg on the nosepiece.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese continued to use their long Type 38 bayonets on their shorter <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Type38Jap0001.jpg">Type 99 rifles</a>, most armies scaled down their knife bayonets, as well as the length of their rifles*, by the time of World War II. A few examples are the bayonets for the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/M1Garand0001.jpg">US M1 Garand</a>, the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/K98Mauser0001.jpg">German K98 Mauser</a>, and the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/K31Swiss0004.jpg">Swiss Schmidt Rubin K31</a> rifles. Shortening the lengths of the blades had the effect of making the bayonets more useful as knives. The bayonets that were issued with <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/AKM0014.jpg">AK-47</a> rifles appear very practical as survival knives.</p>

<p>For every generalization there are exceptions. The Russians used socket bayonets on their WWII Mosin-Nagant rifles. They were somewhat unlike earlier socket bayonets thoughâthey were <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/1938Mosin0006.jpg">cruciform</a>, rather than flat, and terminated with a tip like a <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Mosin tip.jpg">screwdriver</a> or pry bar rather than a point. They were also black rather than shiny, resistant to rust but unable to conjure up images of massed bayonets glinting in the sun. Bayonet charges were always as much psychological weapons as anything.</p>

<p>Iâm unsure exactly why the Russian bayonets were made with a flattened tip, however the purpose for the sawback bayonets issued to German âpioneersâ was to allow them to be used as a hand tool for path breaking. The U.S. issued <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/trowel.jpg">âtrowel bayonetsâ</a> with some <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/1873Trapdoor.jpg">Model 1873 Trapdoor Springfields</a>. While they could serve the usual purpose of a bayonet, the primary purpose for these devices was to serve as entrenching tools, saving the issue and carrying of separate devices for that purpose. Conventional bayonets were done away with entirely for the final Model 1888 Trapdoor Springfields, which had a cleaning rod that could be extended to serve as a bayonet. </p>

<p><a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/MAS36.jpg">French MAS rifles</a> that went into limited production after 1936 and were made in larger numbers post WWII. They also had a rod bayonet that stored in a housing under the barrel and could be removed and reversed if needed. Italian <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Carcano0024.jpg">Carcano carbines</a> sometimes had bayonets that could fold like a jackknife and be carried on the rifle with the blade folded back. Russian and Chinese SKS rifles of the 1950s and 60s commonly have built-in bayonets that folded back unless needed. </p>

<p>The British obtained Mark IV SMLE rifles from American manufacturers during WWII that came with one of a couple different sorts of modified socket bayonets, which fit over the end of the barrel. The most common type had a <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/LeeEnfieldSpike.jpg">simple spike</a>. Others had a standard <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/LeeEnfieldKnife.jpg">knife blade</a>, but, lacking a handle, would have been hard to use off the rifle.</p>

<p>While bayonets are traditionally associated with shoulder arms, there have numerous attempts over the centuries to combine blades with pistols. One example of such a weapon is the double-barreled <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/Percussion pistol.jpg">percussion pistol from Halifax</a>, England.</p>
