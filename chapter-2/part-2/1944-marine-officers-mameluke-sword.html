<p id="date">1944</p>

<div class="text">
<p> "...to the shores of Tripoly." These words from the first verse of the U.S. Marine Corps Anthem refer to the first U.S. military engagement on foreign soil that occurred in 1805. It also marked an American willingness to commit to a war on terrorism scant decades after achieving independence.</p>

<p>Even as early as 1800, portions of the large Ottoman Empire were falling out of the control of the Sultan in Istanbul. This was especially true for territories in North Africa. The Ottoman provinces of Tripoli, Algiers, Tunis, and the independent Sultanate of Morocco began to take advantage of the situation and turned to committing acts of piracy on merchant ships in the Mediterranean. When U.S. began to fall victim to these deprecations, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson made a decision to take action rather than pay the high tributes demanded by the Barbary States. The U.S. sent a fleet of six ships under the command of Commodore Edward Preble to blockade the ports of Tripoli. The fleet also made contact with the Ottoman rules of Egypt and a plan was devised to send a joint force of U.S. Marines and soldiers, and locally recruited mercenaries overland to attack the relatively undefended landward side of the main Barbary port of Derne, while the fleet attacked from the sea. Marine First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led a force of 54 U.S. soldiers and Marines and 400-500 locally recruited mercenaries overland on a march of 600 miles. The naval forces landed a single artillery piece for the use of the land-based forces prior to a joint attack by land and sea. The battle, which occurred on December 8, 1805, was a decisive victory for the U.S. forces. As a gesture of respect and appreciation, the reinstated Ottoman ruler, Prince Hamet, gave Lieutenant O'Bannon a Turkish <a href="../../chapter-4/1780-shamshir.html">Shamshir</a>, of the type known to Europeans as a Mameluke sword.</p>

<p>Mamluks were a class of slave soldiers that came to have great power in certain parts of the Arab world, most notably in Egypt, even before the Ottoman empire was established. The adventures of France and England in Egypt during the early era of Napoleon led to the European association of the shamshir with the Mamluks. The shamshir is a sword that is intended for use by someone on horseback, so it inspired European cavalry sabers. So-called Mameluke swords of European manufacture were carried by both Napoleon and Wellington at Waterloo. It is likely that the sword presented to Lieutenant O'Bannon by Prince Hamet would have had the typical radical curve of a Turkish sword and so might not have been the best choice for a marine. However, when Lieutenant O'Bannon returned to the U.S., the state of Virginia presented him with another honorific sword, which set the pattern for all Marine officer swords to follow when in 1824 the Marines adopted their own pattern for a Mameluke Officer's sword. The Marine sword has a shamshir-like hilt but a relatively straight blade. As with other military swords that originated in the 19th century, the Marine Mameluke sword transitioned from being useful as weapons to being primarily ceremonial objects in the 20th century.</p>

<p>The individual pieces that provide the narrative of this book have come to be included in different ways. Sometimes they have appeared on websites or at shows and I knew enough to think they might be interesting, so I bought them. Sometimes they have just intrigued me and any knowledge came only later, after I had done some research. On other occasions, I have searched out specific sorts of items based on a narrative that developed by my concurrent study of history, or by other items. After acquiring a shamshir, an item that had long been on my wish list, I decided that a Marine Corp Mameluke sword would be an appropriate complement to the U.S. Navy and Army swords already in this collection. It would also to fit with the story of the shamshir.</p>

<p>I discovered that vintage Marine Mameluke swords were not very easy to find, although there were plenty of sources for modern replicas, or even ones officially acceptable as current officer's sword. I located this sword on Ebay when the auction still had several days to go. As you see, the condition is excellent and it is personalized "R O Carlock." I found information on the internet on both a Lieutenant Colonel Robert Owen Carlock and his son Reid Own Carlock. I won the bid and was ultimately able to contact Reid Owen Carlock, now himself a retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<p>Col. Carlock replied: "That sword is most likely my father's sword. Would pay you anything to have it returned. It was stolen out of my car when I was moving from the east coast to Hawaii. My father had given it to me when I was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps in 1968." I tried to work with Reid to negotiate a deal I thought would be fair to both of us. I wanted a replacement sword of comparable condition and some historical provenance or a price that would allow me to buy the replacement myself. I identified a sword that I thought was appropriate, but received several mixed messages from Reid and we were not able to reach an accord.</p>

<p>Before our negotiations fell apart, I obtained the following information about the original owner of this sword. Robert Owen Carlock enlisted in the Navy in 1937 and was selected for the Naval officer's academy. However, medical issues led to his discharge in late 1941 or early 1942. Determined to serve, he enlisted again in the Marine Corps in 1943 and was placed in USMC Officer's Candidate School and commissioned in 1944. He most likely purchased this sword shortly after he received his commission. He was initially a communications officer, and then transitioned to artillery around 1950. He served as artillery liaison officer to Marine ground forces in Korea for a year. He also served with in Viet Nam with 1st Marine Air Wing in DaNang (1965-1966). One thing is certain, that this sword was never carried into battle.</p>
