<p id="date">Circa 1838</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Throughout much of the 19th century, France was looked to as a leader in the design and development of military weapons and tactics, probably largely based on the successes of the innovations brought forward during the time of Napoleon.  The U.S. in particular followed France's lead in areas such as artillery and swordsmanship.  The French Model 1822 cavalry officer's sword was in service for many years and was the basis for the U.S. Model 1840 heavy cavalry saber.  The French swords were made primarily at the army's Châtellerault armory or by Klingenthal, which was at times a royal arsenal, and at other times run privately.  Klingenthal was in Alsace close to the German border, so it was subject to the changing political situations.</p>

<p>Swords made under French government contract carried different markings from those made for commercial sales to officers, and the markings also changed with the company's history.  This sword is marked <i>"Coulaux Freres a' Klingenthal,"</i> consistent with it being a commercial product, rather than a government contract piece.  The Coulaux brothers were managers of Klingenthal from February 1801, and members of the family remained associated with Manufacture de Klingenthal until the company ceased to exist in 1962.</p>

<p>As noted above, the French Model 1822 sword was the pattern for the U.S. "<a href="1849-us-model-1840-cavalry-saber.html">Old Wristbreaker</a>," and a sword like this would have been an acceptable purchase for an American officer in the time period of the Mexican-American war.  It is designed to be a heavy-hitting weapon suitable for both slash and thrust attacks.  However, it comes just before a time when cavalry weapons were due for major changes and reconsideration of purpose.  By the time of the American Civil War, percussion revolvers and breech-loading carbines gave the cavalry entirely new tactics and the saber was no longer the best choice for a weapon in close engagement.  In 1882, the French moved away from curved sabers toward straight blades that were more purposeful as thrusting weapons.  The Model 1822 was replaced with swords like the <a href="1914-french-model-1896-cavalry-saber.html">Model 1896</a>.  This was a direction that would be copied and further developed by the English, and later the U.S., with the 1913 Patton sword.</p>

<p>I purchased this sword in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, several years before I began work on this project.  The decorative motif on the knuckle bow identifies it as an officer's model.  It is hard to say if this sword was entirely assembled by Coulaux, or if only the blade was made by Coulaux and then assembled with a hilt by another sword maker.  The embellishment on the hilt is not a style commonly associated with Coulaux.  According to Jean Binck, who has made a study of Klingenthal swords*, the S and star stamp is from François Charles Schmitt, a one time "Reviseur" for the French Government from July 1821 to March 1835, and later controller the Coulaux Frere private company.  Based on this and other marks, he suggests that the blade was probably issued between 1835 and 1838.  It is perhaps easier to say <i>when</i> this sword was used than <i>where</i> it was used, especially given that it came to me by way of Puerto Rico.  Did it go south with the U.S. Army to Mexico City or did it go east to the Crimean with the French?</p>
