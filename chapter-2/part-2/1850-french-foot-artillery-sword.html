<p id="date">Circa 1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Although post-Napoleonic France did not have a remarkable record of military success, they nonetheless were looked to as models for military organization and ordinance, at least up until the time of the Franco-Prussian War. One area in which they set a lead that the U.S. followed was in regard to sword design. In the era of single-shot muzzle-loading firearms, the concept that a sword carried onto a battlefield might have to serve its primary function as a weapon was a serious consideration. It was also a consideration that they might have to serve other functions as well, and it was important that the design of a particular type of sword should meet the appropriate foreseeable needs.</p>

<p>In 1816, the French introduced a trend-setting design for a sword to be carried by the foot soldiers in artillery units. The sword was patterned on the ancient Roman legionnaire's short sword, or gladius. The Roman legionnaire's primary weapon was usually a lance or javelin (pilum) and they would typically carry a large shield. The short gladius would have presumably been useful for working around their shields as they fought in formation. What would have made the same sword useful for an artillery trooper? For one thing, it would not have been terribly cumbersome, compared to more traditional swords with blades nearly twice as long. It also might have had uses other than as a weapon. Well-placed artillery units would frequently have to find high ground on rough terrain, which meant moving the caissons and gun carriages through forests dense with underbrush. A sword that could be used as a machete might have been useful. The French nickname for the artillery sword was <i>coupe-chou</i> (cabbage cutter), suggesting its usefulness on foliage. As shown in some of the pictures, there is a strong resemblance between the artillery sword and the British bayonet that was issued to early riflemen, such as those who used the <a href="../../pictures/chapter-2/part-2/Bayonets/Individual/swords.jpg">Brunswick two-groove rifle</a>. Riflemen of that era were frequently used as skirmishers and snipers who would have to take out-of-the-way positions and might also have found a "cabbage chopper" useful.</p>

<p>The U.S. adopted swords of this type in 1832, with the Ames Manufacturing Company being the primary supplier. Both sides used them during the Civil War, although the Confederates were at a loss to produce them in adequate numbers. Any sword that can be validated as authentically produced in the Confederacy will carry a premium value, making them also good candidates for counterfeiting. Replica swords can readily be found on the internet for $50 or less (though some vendors ask twice as much).</p>

<p>It is frequently assumed that most swords of this type used by Confederate artillery units came into the South in the cargo holds of blockage-breaking gun runners, and the main source for these swords would have been France. This is a French pattern 1831 artillery sword, only slightly different from the original 1816 pattern. It was produced and used in France up until 1870. The most distinguishing difference between the 1831 and 1816 models is the presence of circular ridges, rather than a fish scale pattern, on the grip. It is marked "Talbot FS, Paris," which along with St. Etienne and Châtellerault, was one of three French armories known to produce these swords. In addition to the maker's mark, there are three other stamps, probably associated with inspectors or the proofing process. However, there is no date or any other marking that would clearly identify it as French military or as an exported item. Of course vendors are often ready to express their certainty that such a piece must have been smuggled into the Confederacy from France, but it is plenty easy to find a sword like this for sale in France today, and easier now than it was in 1862 to have them shipped over to the U.S.</p>
