<p id="date">Circa1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The Shashka-type saber originated in the Caucasus, and is most famously associated with the Cossacks. Shashkas were ultimately adopted by many units of <a href="1895-russian-shashka.html">Russian</a> cavalry, although not universally, since some units instead used European style <a href="1900-russian-cavalry-saber.html">sabers</a>. Some Imperial troops would have been issued mass-produced blades from government armories such as the Zlatoust Arms Factory that also produced <a href="1913-russian-bebut-short-sword.html">bebut</a>-type infantry swords. Russian provincial troops in the Caucuses would have used swords that were made locally.</p>

<p>Shashkas have a long single-edged, mildly curved blade, a bird-head shaped pommel, and no crossguard. As with most sabers, the outside (convex) edge is sharp. It is primarily a slashing weapon intended for use on horseback. The hilts of Imperial Russian swords were often highly decorated. This particular sword however, which came out of Georgia, is unusually plain, but nonetheless clearly made on the model of a shashka. Although it came out of Georgia, its origin might have been anywhere in the Caucasus and perhaps as far afield as Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The hilt appears to have been formed from heated and flattened horn, a technique and material often used to make <a href="../../chapter-4/1800-kurdish-wootz-jambiya.html">jambiya</a> hilts. There is a hole in the back of the hilt, probably due to a naturally occurring hollow in the center of the horn. The flared ears of the pommel are a bit like scaled down versions of a <a href="../../chapter-4/1807-balkan-yataghan.html">yataghan</a> hilt. Although the yataghan also lacks a cross-guard, on a yataghan it is the concave edge of the curved blade that is sharpened.</p>

<p>The condition of the blade on this sword certainly has age-related issues, but appears to have been professionally forged, although there are no maker's or proof marks. It might be that it was originally part of a more conventional saber that was cut down or otherwise adapted to the shashka-type hilt. Alternatively, the blade may have been made in Europe specifically for export to eastern markets. This was not uncommon, many swords like the <a href="../../chapter-4/1870-arab-saif.html">saifs made in Zanzibar</a> used imported blades.</p>

<p>In the late 1700s, Georgia was in a tight squeeze between three empires, the Muslim Ottoman Turk and Safavid Persian Empires to the south, and Russia to the north. The country's fate for the next 100 years was decided in 1801 when Georgia was annexed by Russia. Reportedly, this was done at the request of the Georgian King George XII, who conceded his throne to Tsar Paul 1, much to the displeasure of his relatives. Although inspired by Cossack swords, this is clearly not a Russian military sword. It is tempting to speculate that rather this might have been the sword of Georgian partisan trying to match the current invaders blade for blade.</p>
