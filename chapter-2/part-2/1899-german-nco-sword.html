<p id="date">1899</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This sword passed muster for a German NCO of the post-World War I Weimar republic. Taking the sword out of the scabbard however reveals that it has a rather more interesting story. The blade is finely etched with images of mounted soldiers and horse-drawn artillery. There is also the distinctly Bavarian motto, "In Treue Fest" which is usually translated as "In Loyalty Steadfast."</p>

<p>This basic style of sword was popular in Europe throughout the nineteen century, even up until the end of World War II, which on its own would make it difficult to date this sword with certainty. However, earlier swords of this type usually had ray skin grips, while the base of these grips is a sort of early plastic or Bakelite, as on the <a href="1920-us-model-1902-army-officers-sword.html">American 1902</a> sword for officers. The shape and finish of the knuckle guard is specific for Prussian and post war German swords, not earlier Bavarian models.</p>

<p>There is a mark on the blade of rider and a horse jumping over an obstacle that looks like a both of cloth, which unfurls to make up the letters M and K. Below that, there are numbers separated by a stylized ampersand. The number 18 is on one side of the ampersand and on the other side it appears that 99 has been struck over 88. However, the 88 is spaced oddly with a gap between it and the ampersand, leaving partial room for the overstruck 99. Nonetheless, the eights on the right are the same size and style as the eight in 18, while the nines in 99 are significantly larger characters, consistent with the idea they were struck later. The ampersand, if that is indeed what it is, was clearly struck at the same time as all the rest of the mark, since there is a relief in the profile of the bolt of cloth above to accommodate it.</p>

<p>Some of the information and insights on this sword have been provided and/ or confirmed by expert collectors in this area based on my postings on a specialized forum. I also have several reference books including one specifically on German sword makers. These combined resources, and numerous Google searches, have failed to identify this mark with any known maker of German or Bavarian swords. Members of the forum have suggested that the mark might be from a retailer rather than the maker. The supposition is that perhaps the blade was part of a sword fit with a Bavarian hilt that came into a shop in 1888 and was perhaps only sold in 1899, or that it was an 1888 pattern sold in 1899. Bavarian units in the army of unified Germany were allowed to retain uniforms and weapons that were specifically Bavarian patterns up until 1918 and so this sword could have first been purchased for a noncommissioned officer in a Bavarian Horse Artillery unit, presumably in 1899. Twenty years or more later, it was perhaps refitted with the current regulation German hilt and returned to service. I would like to speculate that a son, proud of the beautiful sword that his father once carried, had it recommissioned for himself.</p>
