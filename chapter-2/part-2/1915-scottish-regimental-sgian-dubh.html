<p id="date">Circa 1915</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The third and smallest member of the triad of blades associated with a Scottish Highlander, and the one most likely to be carried by a Scottish civilian is the sgian dubh. The term translates as something like black or hidden blade. The knife is most often carried in the top band (under the garter) of the knee socks worn as part of traditional Scottish dress. In older times these daggers would might originally have been carried fully concealed, but were moved to a place where it could be seen as a sign of respect or courtesy when entering a home as a guest.</p>

<p>The sgian dubh originated as an all-purpose knife, used to cut meat, peel fruit, or skin animals. Often they have handles made of antler and might also be matched to a larger knife, the Scottish <a href="1870-scottish-regimental-dirk.html">dirk</a>. Today the sgian dubh has lost much of its original purpose and is most often part of Scottish ceremonial dress. However, they are also part of the uniform equipment associated with the Scottish regiments in the British Army.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom "today" (that line being written on September 7, 2014, a few days before the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence), there are stiff laws against the carrying of weapons-but exception is made for the sgian dubh, if and only if, it is worn in the context of traditional Highland garb.</p>

<p>As noted above, a sgian dubh with historical significance would be one that could be associated with a specific Highland regiment. This little dagger was identified by the vendor I purchased it from as a regimental Sgian dubh of the Argyll & Sutherland highlanders. Although this identification was confirmed by the English vendor Andrew Bottomly, from whom I acquired both a Scottish <a href="1630-beaked-nosed-basket-hilt.html">Broadsword</a> and the dirk of the <a href="1870-scottish-regimental-dirk.html">Cameron Regiment</a>, I remain a bit skeptical. It is a lovely piece with some age to it but overall is in very good condition. However, the prominent crowned lion's head badge is not an insignia I have been able to associate with the Argyll & Sutherlands. The badge is that of the Clan Gregor, the family of very early Scottish kings and active instigators of, or participants in, several wars for Scottish independence. Rob Roy, the Scottish Robin Hood was a MacGregor. The Gregor Clan was one of those most actively suppressed after the ultimate failure of the Jacobites (supporters of the Stewart dynasty) at the battle of Culloden in 1746. The persecution of the MacGregors only ended in 1774, at which time the laws against them were repealed. It is therefore likely that this sgian dubh belonged to a MacGregor, perhaps one who served in the Argyll & Sutherland highlanders in the early 20th century. My jeweler friend, Bernie Reller, looked at this piece and was impressed by the fine quality of the engraving. He remarked that the Lion badge was certainly not of the same quality, consistent with it having a separate origin.</p>

<p>The Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders were created in 1881 and existed until 2004. Their royal patron was Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, who was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The 91st Argyllshire regiment, a forerunner of the Argyll & Sutherlands, formed the honor guard for the wedding of Princess Louise to John Douglas Sutherland Campbell. The Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders served in all of the principle engagements of the British Army from the Boer War to World War I.</p>
