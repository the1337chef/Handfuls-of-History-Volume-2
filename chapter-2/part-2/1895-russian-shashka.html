<p id="date">Circa 1895</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The term "Cossack" was used to apply to any of several clans (Hosts) who lived primarily in the frontier territories between Poland and Russia. They were, for the most part, ethnically related to other Slavic peoples, but famously they were Slavs who would not be slaves. They always counted themselves as free peoples, and were at all times ready to make war on anyone who thought otherwise of them. The Hosts were usually named for their original native territories, typically river valleys and deltas, including those of the Don, Danube, and Dnieper rivers. The Cossacks of the Dnieper area were also known as being "of the Zaporozhian Sich" (referring to their isolated military fortress, likely the inspiration for the Freman Sietch imagined by Frank Herbert in his Dune novels).</p>

<p>The fierce independence and military prowess of the Cossacks made it a practical decision for the autocratic states of Poland and, most famously, Russia, to take them as semiautonomous allies and use their forces as military auxiliaries. As such, the Cossacks defended the buffer zone between the Empires and protected both states from the hostile Tartars, remnants of the Golden Horde, who ruled Khanates in the Crimea and to the East of the Ural Mountains. Although the Cossacks would sometimes serve along side of the armies of their patron monarchs, they recognized only the authority of their own tribal leader, their "Hetman." The military importance of the Cossack Hosts was well proven to the Czars by the time of Ivan "the Great" (or "the Terrible" depending on your perspective). Of course, the independence of Cossacks sometime rankled the autocrats who counted on their service as allies, so wars between the Cossacks and their patrons were not uncommon.</p>

<p>Around 1580, the Hetman Yermak Timofeyevich had a falling out with the Czar Ivan, which caused Yermak to lead his modest Host of less than a thousand men to the eastern border territories administered by the merchant Stroganov family, lands of the former Tatar khanate of Kazan, who had recently been conquered by Imperial Russian armies. Sources differ on whether the Cossack forces were dispatched by the Stroganovs to adventure further east, or whether they struck out on their own initiative, but by 1584 Yermak's small army achieved the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir, and thus were able to deliver to Ivan the enormous, albeit sparsely populated, territory of Siberia, expanding the borders of Imperial Russia to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The Czars sent Cossack units to wherever they were most needed, although these deployments were not always fully appreciated by the leader of the regular Imperial forces, since, as noted above, the Cossacks were often judged to be undisciplined and answered only to their own Hetman. After Persia ceded their territories in the Caucuses to Russia in the early 19th century, Cossack Hosts were sent along with the Imperial troops to help enforce Russian rule on the Circassians and the Islamic peoples of Dagestan who, led by the Emir Shamyl, resisted Russian rule for over 30 years. During this time, many Cossacks adopted the traditional weapons of the Caucuses, both the <a href="../../chapter-4/1870-kindjal.html">kindjal</a> and the shashka. Although the Cossack forces were issued firearms by their Russian allies, traditionally, they supplied their own horses and swords. The sword smiths of Tbilisi were famous for the quality of their weapons, and so it is quite understandable that the Cossacks adopted these weapons. One stylistic difference between the Cossack shashka and a typical shashka of the Caucuses, was that the scabbard for a Cossack shashka stopped at the base of the grip, while that of a Georgian or <a href="../../chapter-4/1850-murid-shashka.html">Dagestan</a> shashka would extend a couple of inches higher over the base of the grip.</p>

<p>By 1834, the Russians began to produce what they referred to as Cossack shashkas at the Imperial armory at Zlatoust. These were issued to cavalry troopers recruited from Nizhegorodka to serve in the Caucuses. These early Russia shashkas were very plain, similar to the common <a href="1850-georgian-shashka.html">Georgian</a> shashka, but with simple handles made of wood rather than horn. This first guard-less Russian military Shashka was designated "lower ranks, Asian design, Pattern 1834." Its officer version differed only having in non-standard decorations. The next Russian Shashka was Pattern 1838, followed by the "lower ranks artillery shashka" of 1868, both of which had some brass fitting on the wood grips. Although the Russians continued to issue some units <a href="1900-russian-cavalry-saber.html">sabers</a> with European-style guarded handles, by 1890 the new "1881 Pattern" Shashka became standard issue to most Russian troops, both cavalry and infantry. Also, by about 1900 Russia adopted the kindjal-style <a href="1913-russian-bebut-short-sword.html">bebut</a> short sword for artillery units. After the start of World War I, the scabbards of the Shashkas issued to common soldiers had an attachment for the M1891 Mosin Nagant <a href="bayonets.html">bayonet</a>. After the communist revolution, a pattern 1927 Shashka was issued to Soviet troops, complete with stamped emblems of the new state. Of course, by 1927, the image of the Cossack had been fully romanticized and ingrained in Russian Psyche, accepted as a nationalist icon even by the Soviets, in spite of the fact that more Cossacks fought with the White army than with the Reds after the revolution. The Bolsheviks ultimately instituted a policy of "decossackization" that, according to 21st century historians, resulted in the deaths or deportation of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Cossacks.</p>

<p>"Shaf & Sons," a large private company, made this particular sword, probably an officer's private purchase. The company's founder, Wilhelm Shaf, was a German who, in 1815, moved from the German sword making city of Solingen to Zlatoust, the site of the large Imperial Russian armory. Wilhelm and his three sons were hired to teach Russian workers German techniques. In 1824, the Shaf family left Zlatoust and established a private company in St. Petersburg where this sword was made. The blade inscription says "For the Tsar and Fatherland." The blade also bears the monogram of the last Tsar, Nicolas II, who ascended to the throne in November 1884. The Shaf family left Russia after the 1917 revolution. This sword might have been in use during the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, as well as during World War I. It survived the Communist revolution and its aftermath, however, with its dedication to the Czar, it is unlikely to have ever been the sword of a Bolshevik.</p>
