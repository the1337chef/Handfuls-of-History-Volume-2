<p id="date">Circa 1820</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This large hunting knife, most likely from south Italy, was one of three Italian knives I acquired from the San Giorgia auction. The style of the blade is very reminiscent of American <a href="1855-slater-bros-sheffield-bowie.html">Bowie</a> knives, many of which were made in England for the American market. In fact, a knife with a similar blade is shown in figure 43 (H) from "Armi Bianche dal Mediebo all'Eta Moderna," and is identified as "Coltello all'Americana." This knife however, is far larger than the typical American/English Bowie knife and has beautiful decorative features that you would never have expected to see on the American frontier. The blade is half-and-a-half fullered in the center and chiseled with foliage and rampant lions on one side and a horse on the other. The handle alone is a true work of art, made of with rows of bone disks of different colors, spaced by engraved white metal rings with an engraved collar and pommel.</p>

<p>The beautiful qualities of this knife were not so evident from the relatively low-resolution pictures provided by the auction house, and in fact the details of the rampant lions were not obvious at all. In one picture of the knife held vertically, with the lions upside down, they looked like arms folded in prayer. With the handle looking like the Papal tiara, I thought perhaps it was intended as an effigy of the pontiff, albeit a faceless one.</p>

<p>I asked my blacksmith friend, <a href="../../damascus-steels.html">Steve Bloom</a>, how he thought the figures and fuller were worked into the steel of this knife. He suggested that the blade was forged to shape and ground to close to final dimensions. The steel was then fully annealed prior to the engraving. Only then would it have been heat treated to harden the steel. While fullers are often forged in place, he suspects that these were also carved, since they might have "messed up the canvas" for engraving if not perfectly placed.</p>

<p>The stereotypical Bowie knife evolved over time and probably had its origin in common butcher knives with certain Spanish and Mediterranean influences. While this knife has the clip point, typical of a Bowie knife, it lacks the cross guard of a Coltello all'Americana. The clip point improves the usefulness of the knife for thrusting attacks, but the false edge is just that, not sharpened, so that tip is relatively thick and sturdy. This really is a weapon that relies on the edge more than the point. It is so massive that it feels almost like a cleaver. It seems far more massive than anything a hunter would want to use to dress game. It has enough mass that you could almost chop wood with it, but it is no machete, or even the sort of "cabbage chopper" that the <a href="../part-2/1850-french-foot-artillery-sword.html">French artillery swords</a> were. It seems unlikely that the joint between the blade and handle would hold up long with really hard use.</p>

<p>Perhaps this knife was intended to be used at the table to carve the roast, rather than in the field during the actual hunt. If it was carried by the owner, it would testify to the owner's affluence and status, as well has provide a serious weapon with the pretense of only being a hunting tool.</p>
