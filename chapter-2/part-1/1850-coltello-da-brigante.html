<p id="date">Circa 1850</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Although Italy was a cradle for European civilization, for most of the fourteen hundred years that followed the fall of Rome, the Italian peninsula was a patchwork mosaic of rival city states and warring kingdoms. Conflicts between these states were often settled by troops of mercenaries and these mercenaries, once unemployed, sometimes turned to banditry. Troops of brigands would be a danger to travelers and people living in isolated villages. Sometimes, small towns would hire one troop of brigands to protect them from other bands.</p>

<p>In southern Italy in particular, dispossessed farmers and peasants would also augment the ranks of the brigand companies, especially in regions where the feudal lords ruled oppressively. Bands large enough, or bold enough, to engage the troops of such a lord became heroes to the people and could find refuge in the smaller villages or pass over the borders into rival states where they could find refuge, or even sometimes employment. Although, more often than not, considered criminals by the rulers of the Italian states, the leaders of the brigand armies were also romantic figures.</p>

<p>One famous brigand leader was Marco Sciarra-illo of the Abruzzi. When hard pressed by the Spanish who ruled Naples at that time, he would lead his troops across the borders into the Papal States and stay until the opportunity arose to cross back. Once however, the Viceroy of Naples allied with the Pope, and Sciarra-illo fled further and took service with Venice. He remained in contact with comrades in Naples and eventually a fatal trap was set for him on one of his visits home.</p>

<p>By the second half of the 19th century, brigandage in Southern Italy evolved into something close to a political resistance movement, as the royalists of the Kingdom of Naples attempted to form an army out of the brigand corps to oppose Garibaldi and the armies of the north that supported Victor Emmanuel. Ultimately, the successful unification of Italy in 1871 resulted in a general suppression of the brigand forces, although some will argue that the spirit of the brigand lives on in the Italian Mafia.</p>

<p>With a 14.5-inch blade, this dagger is large enough to be considered a short sword. It was clearly the possession of self-proclaimed brigand. The inscribed motto proudly declares, "I don't have a heart. Do not trust me."</p>

<p>Like the <a href="1820-italian-hunting-knife.html">hunting knife</a> and <a href="1700-sicilian-coltello.html">Sicilian</a> dagger that I also obtained from the San Giorgia auction, this coltello (dagger) is exquisitely fashioned, with impressive engraving and beautiful handle that is fashioned from disks of multicolored horn and brass.  The disks were probably fused with some sort of resin so that they could then be carved as a single piece with the spiraling pattern. A modern knife maker, Bill Scagel (1873-1963), was famous for using a similar technique for his knife handles, which usually had a pommel from a deer antler. His work seems primitive compared to the handle of this knife.</p>

<p>Images of a brigand officer are sculpted on both sides of the blade's ricasso. They look as though they could be caricatures of the same person, and so probably they represent the owner of the dagger. On one side there is a cartouche with the initials "GGV," also likely those of the original owner.</p>
