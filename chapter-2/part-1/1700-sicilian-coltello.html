<p id="date">Circa 1700</p>

<div class="text">
<p> This is one of three Italian knives I acquired in an on-line auction from San Giorgia in Genoa, Italy. They sell a book titled "Il Coltello Genovese", that I purchased in the hope that it might include knives similar to the ones I bought. It did not, so I would assume that the three knives, although they appear to be Italian, are probably not from Genoa. Based on a figure in "Armi Bianche dal Mediebo all'Eta Moderna"*, this dagger with a hooked grip maybe from Sicily, and date to the 17th or 18th century. However, the dagger illustrated in Armi Bianche has the grip on the top of a single edged blade, while this piece, with a somewhat wide double-edged triangular blade, almost reminds me of a cinquedea, although the blade is not as wide as a typical cinquedea. The name, cinquedea means "five fingers" referring to the width of the blade at the top. The blade of this dagger is 1.75 inches wide at the top and 9.5 inches long.</p>

<p>This is certainly beautifully made weapon, with brass inlays and nicely engraved steel. The brass panels at the top of the blade look as though they would have been a perfect spot for some sort of personalization, such as a monogram or a motto, but they are only textured. It is hard to say if the panels are intended to represent a tabletop or a bookstand, or if they are just decorative. The grip appears to be designed for a relatively small hand, although I do not find it uncomfortable to hold and the hook allows it to be held firmly. I considered whether this dagger might have been intended for a woman, but it seems too large for a woman to carry, although perhaps with a suitable scabbard, it might have worked with traveling or hunting garb.</p>

<p>While the uniqueness of the design is something that attracted me to this dagger, it also makes it hard to pin down its origin and intended use, aside from self-defense in a romantic age. I have not been able to find anything else that would tie it to Sicily. Throughout the 17th century, Sicily was an independent kingdom ruled by relatives of the King of Aragon (Spain). Sicily subsequently became a prize sought by the contenders in the Spanish wars of succession. In 1735, the Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V, installed his younger son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King Charles VII of Naples and Sicily. This cadet branch of the Bourbon family ruled Sicily until it was conquered by Napoleon in 1799. The Bourbon control of the country was weak and undermined by corruption and rival feudal lords who mistreated the lower classes. At this time groups of <a href="1850-coltello-da-brigante.html">brigands</a>, self-named "Mafia," arose in the villages to oppose the overlords and have ever since controlled parts of Sicily in their own way from the shadows.</p>

<p>*This title translates to "White Weapons from the Middle Ages to the Modern Age". There are not really very many modern weapons covered and I might have guessed "White" referred to White people, since the catalog does not cover Asian or African weapons, however I understand that it probably refers to white metal (steel) weapons.</p>
