<p id="date">Circa 1888</p>

<div class="text">
<p>The island of Crete is now part of Greece and its history has been intertwined with that of its closest mainland neighbor for thousands of years. The earliest writings believe to be in the Greek language are in a pictographic script (Linear B) derived from an earlier Minoan script (Linear A) developed on Crete. Prior to 1500 BCE the Minoans possessed one of the most advanced civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although they were not renown for being war-like (their cities were not enclosed by defensive walls), if there is any basis to the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, the city states of mainland Greece paid tribute to Minoans. Sometime around the year 1500 BCE the volcano that was the island of Santorini (Thera), 68 miles north of Crete, exploded. The explosion not only destroyed the Minoan cities on Thera but it is likely that the resulting earthquakes and Tsunami did major damage to Minoan centers in northern Crete as well. Archeological records, however, indicate the damage was rapidly repaired and that the real coup de gras to the Minoan civilization came from military invasion, most likely from the Mycenaean Greeks, who were the ancestors of the Greeks who, a couple hundred years later, would take war to the city of Troy on the coast of Anatolia.</p>

<p>The settlements on Crete became absorbed into Mycenaean sphere and, like the cities in mainland Greece, they fell into the period of dark ages following the Dorian invasion of Greece. This period coincided with the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The Greek city states that emerged on Crete from this Dark Age were not unlike those on the Greek mainland and the Aegean and Ionian islands. However, the settlements on Crete never achieved any notable preeminence in the arts or politics during the Classical Greek era.</p>

<p>Crete was not in the direct path of Alexander the Great's conquests, but was nonetheless swept along into the Hellenistic era and later, like the rest of Greece, was destined to become part of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Crete was part of the Byzantine Empire but its geographical isolation made it an early target for Islamic expansion, specifically at the hands of Iberian adventurer Abu Hafs and his followers. In 820 they established an autonomous emirate on the island, which served as base for piracy, largely directed at Byzantine trade. The Byzantines recaptured the island in 961, and held it until, as a result of the misdirected fourth Crusade, it became a Venetian territory. It remained in the control of Venice until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1669. This cycle of conquests produced a unique cultural mix on Crete with a vestige of Venetian influence and a large Muslim minority population.</p>

<p>While mainland Greece obtained their independence from Turkey in 1829, the battle on Crete was longer and very hard fought. Crete eventually became independent from Turkey in 1898 and was united with mainland Greece on the eve of the First World War in 1913.</p>

<p>With all these tidbits of history, the origins of the sort of knife or dagger associated with Crete are nonetheless a bit of a puzzle. That there is indeed such a pattern is clear, knives of the current pattern date back to the late 18th century. There are craftsmen on Crete that still make such knives on offer through the internet for a range of prices depending on the maker and the specifications. Knives with all of the features of this one are easily 1000 Euros or more.</p>

<p>A large number of the pieces in this book and information related to them have come from Artzi Yarom of Oriental Arms. The online listings of Oriental Arms include both items for sale and those previously sold. A search found 21 daggers/ knives from Crete in the Oriental Arms catalog, including this one and only one other still available for sale. This gave a pretty good sample size to determine what defines the style of a Cretan dagger. The grip on the Cretan dagger is called the "manika." The sole consistent feature in these daggers is the wedge shaped cutout in the rear of the grip, which to me is reminiscent of Turkish Yatagan. However on a Yatagan these ears flare out from the line of the grip while on 85% of the knives from Crete the manika is a smooth wedge shape with a wedge just cut into the base of the grip, as on this piece. In the Oriental Arms sample, 76% have grips of ivory or whitened bone, while the rest have grips of dark horn. The blades are engraved to varying degrees on 76% of the pieces. On just 3 of the pieces there are numbers or words as part of the engraving and on the rest, the engraving is stylized design, as on this piece. On one piece, the design is essentially identical to the one on this knife and on several others it is clearly meant to be similar. The average length of the knives (in the scabbards) is 12.5 inches (with a standard error of the mean of 0.5 inches). At 16 inches, this piece is significantly larger than average. Another feature that is common to all the knives is the single-edged blade with a thick incised back edge. The decorative grip straps are also consistent, and on this piece the grip straps and bolster are pewter to which silver paint has been applied. The silver paint is not typical, suggesting that someone made an attempt to dress up this knife. The use of six pins to anchor the blade in the hilt is an older style, more modern pieces use only three pins.</p>

<p>Aside from the aforementioned Turkish influence, it is hard to say how the definitively Cretan style of knife evolved or when. The two knives from the Oriental Arms sample that have dates come from 1892 and 1900, the final years of Turkish occupation, but as noted above, the style dates to at least the late 18th century. It is certain that these knives had a special association with the Independence movement. You are unlikely to see a picture of a Cretan partisan without an identifiably Cretan style dagger in their belt. However, these knives and daggers were integral to many aspects of social life in Crete prior to the 20th century and even featured in Cretan marriage ceremonies.</p>
