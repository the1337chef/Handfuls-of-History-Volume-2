<p id="date">1867</p>

<div class="text">
<p> Francis Henry Crozier, Esq., was born on September 5, 1812 in Bath, Somerset, England. He joined the British East India Company in 1831 and held several administrative positions in India over the next thirty years. The company logs list him sometimes as a magistrate and sometimes as a judge. He married his first wife, Harriet Bensley Gresham Paske, in 1836 at Masulipatam in India. They had one son, Gresham Paske Rawson Crozier, who died in 1870. Harriet died in 1837, just a few months after Gresham was born.</p>

<p>On October 13, 1846 Francis Crozier was remarried in Lymington, Hampshire, England to Harriet Burrard, daughter of Reverend Sir George Burrard. They returned to India and had six children between 1847 and 1855: Harriet Frances Crozier, born in Madras, India; Emma Corrie Crozier, also born in Madras, India; Burrard Rawson Crozier, born in Bimlipatam, India; Pearson Francis Crozier, born in Vizianagram, India; Gertrude Julia Crozier, born in Waltair, India; and Mary Alice Crozier, born circa 1855 in Nellore, India. All of these children survived to adulthood and married.</p>

<p>Although Francis Crozier is never associated with a title other than Esquire, he was considered a (lesser) member of the peerage. Most of the information above comes from an online index of the English Peerage.*</p>

<p>Service in the East India Company was good employment for an English gentleman. However, in 1857, it seemed that all of that might come to an end when many of the Indian soldiers in service to the company mutinied. From May 1857 to June 1858 the East India Company lost control of the country, and the British interests in India had to be rescued by units of the British Regular Army. The rebellious units of native Sepoys, both Muslim and Hindu, were supported by several kings and sultans of the Princely states, and the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was also persuaded to throw in with the rebels as they converged on Delhi. Twenty-one of the other, nominally independent, Princely states of India prudently remained in support of the British, who also retained Nepal as an ally. Many mutineers ultimately fled to Nepal at the end of the rebellion and were compelled to surrender their <a href="../../chapter-5/1858-indian-mutiny-tulwar.html">Tulwars</a> and other weapons at the border.</p>

<p>Had the rebellion been successful, it would have been a chance for the Mughal Emperor to regain control of his kingdom, but with the British victory, the Mughal Empire was dissolved. In a sense, the East India Company shared the fate of the Mughal Empire, since after the war the Company was dissolved and Queen Victoria took for herself the title of "Empress of India."</p>

<p>The year of the rebellion must have been a terrifying experience for Francis Henry Crozier and his family. Stories of the slaughter of English civilians were plentiful and not all were exaggerated. In Lucknow nearly a thousand civilians, soldiers, and servants were under siege for over six months. In the neighboring town of Cawnpore the British citizens and soldiers were held prisoner for weeks and eventually were all massacred, including women and children who were hacked to pieces. Reportedly, the bodies of women and children were thrown into a 50-foot-deep well, filling it to within 6 feet from the top. Once the British retook the town and knowledge of the massacre was made public, the British resolve and public opinion hardened against the rebels. The severity of later British reprisals was merciless, in large part because of the rage over Cawnpore.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that in total, several hundred British civilians died as a consequence of the Indian mutiny along with perhaps ten times as many Anglo-Indians and Indians in service to the British. The British army lost 11,000 men, three-quarters of those killed by disease or heatstroke. These numbers pale in comparison to the number of Indian casualties, most of which were victims of the subsequent British reprisals.</p>

<p>Although the management of India changed hands from Company to Crown in 1859, there was still a need for bureaucrats like Francis Henry Crozier, and sources indicate that he remained in the Indian service until 1861. It is likely that he retained a residence in India for some time after that, although he also probably had a home in England, since he was listed as an English land commissioner in 1861. One bit of evidence that he kept a residence in India is that several years after the end of the mutiny his two eldest daughters married British officers who had fought against the mutiny and were still in service in India. The eldest daughter, Harriet, married General Osbourne Creagh in November 1866. At the time of their marriage she was just 20 and he was 43. They had three sons and three daughters, two of whom died young.</p>

<p>The groom, Charles Creagh-Osborne (born December 20, 1823), served as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot in 1841, and in 1842 he joined the Camel Corps in India. He later became the Superintendent of Garrison Instructors in India in 1873 and then returned to England where he was Commandant of the Staff College, Sandhurst from 1878. At some point in his career he was made a member of the "Order of the Bath."</p>

<p>On February 17, 1869 Francis Crozier's second daughter, Emma Corrie Crozier, married Major General William Smith at St. James's, Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, England. The groom was in the Royal Artillery and served in India during the mutiny. At the time of his wedding William Smith was 34 and his bride was 21. She had been only ten years old at the time of the mutiny. Emma and William had four sons and two daughters. The two daughters both died in infancy. Two of their sons became British officers-Colonel William Francis Smith of the Artillery Service, and Commander Burrard Archibald Smith of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>Francis Crozier died on February 9, 1905 at the age of 92. His second wife Harriet predeceased him in 1875. He was survived by his eldest daughter Harriet and his youngest daughter Mary Alice.</p>

<p>The inscription on the grip of this small sword indicates that it was presented to Francis Crozier in 1867. The small or short swords of this type evolved from the heavier and more purposeful rapiers of the late Renaissance. The occasion to use such swords as weapons were minimal, aside from a duel now and then by persons so inclined. However, by the 18th century it was nonetheless still expected that members of the gentry would carry swords as status symbols and fashion accessories on formal occasions. By the time Francis Crozier was given this sword, occasions for a civilian to wear a sword were probably relatively rare. It might have been expected and appropriate for state balls or other evening parties hosted by the crown, as well as courts where women and levees and men were formally presented to the monarch. Because of this association with such formal occasions, swords of this sort became known as "court swords." Of course, for most of Francis Crozier's life the British monarch was Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>People attending official court occasions might wear "court uniforms" if they held military or administrative posts. Such uniforms were a notch up from standard dress uniforms, resplendent with gold braid and other trimmings. Other members of the gentry and peerage would wear "court dress," which at the time of Francis Crozier would have comprised a tailcoat and matching waistcoat, breeches and stockings, lace cuffs and cravat, a fancy hat, and a court sword.</p>

<p>This is a lovely example of a court sword, elegant and not unduly ostentatious. When I purchased it I had a choice between this and another far fancier one, that was quite ostentatious, but in a rhinestone kind of way. The vendor urged me that the fancy one was "the better sword" but I disagreed, and moreover I wanted this one because I thought (correctly) it would take me to the history of the owner. The sword is marked "C. Webb, 23 Old Bond Street, London." Webb was one of numerous suppliers of such regalia who were based on Old Bond Street. Most likely Webb was not the actual sword smith, although he might have done the etching. It was common for guns and swords to be marked for the retailer, just as items marked "Sears" are actually made <i>for</i> Sears, not by Sears. The etching is in beautiful high relief. The motifs are decorative rather than militant. Prominent in the etching is the royal sigil of Queen Victoria. The scabbard was nice but the leather is aged and there was a repair. The tab on the scabbard would have allowed the sword to be carried in a leather frog or similar hanger. The use of a frog is convenient since it allows the sword to be attached or removed without removal of the sword belt.</p>

<p>So, who actually presented this sword to Francis Crozier, and was it in honor of a particular occasion? The date of 1867 is close enough to the date of the wedding of Francis's daughter Harriet to General Osbourne Creagh to lead me to speculate that there might be a connection. Perhaps the general paid for the sword himself or promoted the idea to whoever did. In any case, it seems reasonable that there might have been a reception for the groom and his new bride and her family at court. This would have been an occasion for Mr. Crozier to need a proper court sword. I wonder too about the beginning and progression of the romance between Francis's second daughter Emma and her general. Did the two perhaps meet at Harriet's wedding? Had either of these presumably gallant soldiers known their future brides as girls during the time of the mutiny?</p>

<p>This sword brought a treasure of facts about Francis Crozier and his family, and from those facts can come a certain amount of imagining. I do imagine that Mr. Crozier was quite honored to receive this sword, but it is very likely that he wore it on just one occasion.</p>
