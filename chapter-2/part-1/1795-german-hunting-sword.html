<p id="date">Circa 1795</p>

<div class="text">
<p> By the late 1700s a well-to-do Northern European country gentleman would probably not carry a sword as they went about their business. It would not be unusual, however, for them to own one to have at hand when an appropriate occasion arose. Hunting wild boar would certainly have been such an occasion. As good a shot as one might be, it would be unwise to rely too much on a single-shot muzzle-loaded rifle when hunting dangerous game. Even if the target were hit, a sword, <a href="1750-german-hunting-sword-plug-bayonet.html">plug bayonet</a>, or lance might still be required for delivering the <i>coup de grâce</i>. <a href="1850-hungarian-hunting-sword.html">Hunting swords</a> were therefore common, and many of these were of a style known as "hangers."</p>

<p>The term "hanger," when used in English, probably works with the obvious association of a sword hung from a belt, however there is some speculation that the term comes from the same root as the Indo-Persian word for a dagger, <a href="../../chapter-5/1740-mughal-khanjar.html"><i>khanjar</i></a>. A hanger is in some ways similar to a <a href="../part-2/1842-french-naval-cutlass.html">cutlass</a>, medium sized and usually single edged. Cutlasses, of course, usually have naval associations, and commonly have a somewhat curved blade and a large hand-guard, but hangers have also frequently been the weapon of choice for naval officers. A hanger, typically, has a straight blade and a simple knuckle bow and/ or cross-guard. While not all hangers are hunting swords, most hunting swords could be considered hangers. Hangers used as hunting swords often have grips or handles made of antler.</p>

<p>A gentleman called to military, or especially Militia, service might bring with him his civilian hanger, as officers typically had to provide their own swords. George Washington carried a hanger throughout most of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>The dimensions and style of this sword fit the classification of a "hanger," although in the German state in which it originated, it might have been called a <i>Jagd Schwert</i> or a <i>Messer</i>. In addition to being of high quality and excellent condition, this sword was provided with the additional feature of having a flintlock pistol built onto it.</p>

<p>Combination weapons, while not typical, were not terribly uncommon either, the most common being the use of a <a href="../part-2/bayonets.html">bayonet</a> with a musket or other long gun. The incorporation of a pistol onto a sword is far less common. As threatening as it may appear, it is unclear how far a small-bore pistol, as installed on this piece, would really extend the reach offered by the sword itself.</p>

<p>The pistol and sword elements of this weapon were almost certainly made separately, with the sword maker perhaps offering a pistol as an accessory to a high quality sword. It is the pistol maker who has given us the clearest identification, having signed his work, "Hock-I-Mayntz." Mayntz is an archaic alternative spelling for Mainz. My friend Alain, webmaster of the "Little Gun" Belgian data base web site identifies the pistol maker as Johann Anton Hock. A genealogy web site found "Johan Anton Hock, born December 1, 1761 in Gerichstetten, Baden, and died March 25, 1831." Baden was part of the former Duchy of Württemberg, not far from the city of Mainz. Baden now forms part of the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg, the Duchy having been absorbed into the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. While the sword maker also left marks, three stars and a crescent, they are not so easily traced. They may be the maker's trademarks or perhaps not. I have seen other swords with similar marks on an internet forum which were rather crudely made cutlasses. One forum member suggested that "The crescent moon and stars is a Cabalistic design used for many centuries, but especially popular among the German smiths."</p>

<p>I wish I could identify the sword maker, since overall the piece seems to be a cut above most hunting swords of the era. The castings are especially nice and go remarkably well with what appears to be the polished horn of the handle itself, even to the color and grain which give the appearance of tiger eye topaz. Features, like the face cast on the back strap of the grip, are interesting departures from usual military images, such as that of an eagle's head. It is probably meant to represent the "Green man," a common image for hunters in that era.</p>

<p>Anton Hock's boar's head pistol is itself another real work of art. Whether it declares power against the hunter's prey or evokes the beast as the owner's ally is a question open for interpretation. I am pretty sure that the barrel of the pistol would screw off, probably with the use of a special tool to fit in the bore to engage the pronounced rifling. That would make it easy to clean and reload. Alternatively, the entire pistol module looks as though it could easily be released by undoing a couple of screws on the other side.</p>

<p>I think it is a safe assumption that this sword-pistol was made for a German gentleman of the later 1700s. Was he a boar hunter or more than that? The blade shows some signs of serious use and this sword comes from a time when the German states were hard pressed by the armies of Napoleon. As George Washington took his hanger to war, perhaps this sword went to war for Baden in the time of Napoleon.</p>
