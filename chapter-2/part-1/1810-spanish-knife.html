<div class="text">
<p> The Canary Islands are a Spanish-controlled archipelago located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa. The islands were known to the Romans and probably visited by Phoenicians and Carthaginians as well. In ancient times the islands were said to have supported a large population of dogs, and so the name for the islands comes from <i>canis</i>, the Latin word for dogs. As is often the case with isolated archipelagos, the islands are home to numerous unique animals, including the small, subsequently domesticated songbirds that take their name from the islands.</p>

<p>Perhaps as early as 1000 BCE the islands were colonized by people related to the Berbers of North Africa, and these aboriginal people came to be known as the Guanches. Spanish explorers became interested in the islands as early as 1402, and by the end of the 15th century the islands were conquered and henceforth considered a territory of Castilian Spain. The islands became an important supply port for the early Spanish explorers, and the Spanish also established a single-crop agricultural economy on the island, first with sugarcane and later with wine grapes.</p>

<p>As with many peoples having a long-lived cultural identity, the inhabitants of the Canary Islands developed a traditional type of knife. The Canary Island knife has clear connections to the Spanish <a href="1920-albacete-dagger.html">Albacete daggers</a>, but distinctive differences. Individual pieces became treasured family heirlooms, and no man on the islands would be without one. However, the knife is considered more of a utilitarian item than a weapon. It could be used in the kitchen, in the field to cut grass and sticks, or to graft shoots onto banana trees. While it is said that for men on the island "going about without a knife is like going about naked," it is also said that should two men begin a fight, the first thing they do is set aside their knives.</p>

<p>The quality of workmanship on most Canary knives is quite high. This knife suffers from age, especially in the pitting on the blade, but is otherwise clearly a high-quality piece. The hilt is composed of a bone grip with brass mounts, features shared with Albacete daggers. However, while the Spanish daggers are double-edged with a hilt mounted on the mid-line, the knives of the Canaries are single-edged with the grip mounted more in the style of a <a href="1980-sabatier.html">kitchen knife</a>.</p>
