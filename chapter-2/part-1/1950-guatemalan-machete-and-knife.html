<p id="date">Circa 1950</p>

<div class="text">
<p> The distinctive style of their handles suggests that these two pieces have a common origin. I acquired the larger piece first, from Oriental Arms. Artzi described it as: "a long machete sword, most probably from Mexico or otherwise a neighboring country in Central America. Nicely re-curving blade, double edged, 23 inches long. Long black horn handle carved as a human figure and set with colored stone inserts. Tooled leather scabbard. Total length 32 inches. Very good condition. Minor edge nicks." However, the handle looked African to me, so I asked Artzi about that and he replied in an e-mail: "Very good question on the origin. I am not sure at all and to add to my confusion this sword was purchased together with other African lots. But the blade shape and the scabbard are much Mexican." It is true that while most often machetes have a straight single edged blade with a more round than pointed tip, there is a native Mexican style of machete that has a blade shaped similarly to this piece.</p>

<p>I posted Artzi's pictures on the Ethnographic Weapons forum and a forum member noted the similarities between the hilt on the machete and a style of souvenir knife from Guatemala. A quick search with Google brought me to eBay where I was able to purchase the knife shown here for comparison.</p>

<p>Spanning the width of Central America, approximately 236 miles from the Atlantic to Pacific oceans, Guatemala today is a popular tourist destination, especially for the Mayan archaeological sites, such as Tikal. Like most of Central and South America, Guatemala was "colonized" by Spain, and also like much of Central America, Guatemala has had a turbulent political history since obtaining independence in 1821.</p>

<p>Although the largest population group in Guatemala (41.5%) is Mestizo, with mixed indigenous and European (Spanish) heritage, approximately 40% of the population descends from various Mayan tribes. Another popular tourist destination is the town of Santo Tomás Chichicastenango, known for its traditional Maya Indian culture. The original name of the town was Chaviar but the Spanish soldiers renamed it based on the name used by Nahuatl Indians; Tzitzicaztenanco, or City of Nettles.</p>

<p>Chichicastenango is described by Wikipedia as "a small and stucco-white town, lying on the crests of mountaintops located about 87 miles northwest of Guatemala City at an altitude of 6,447 ft." The town is famous for its market, and apparently vendors at the Chichicastenango market have sold this style of souvenir knife for a number of years. Usually a search of eBay for "Chichicastenango knife" will return between three and six items similar to the example shown. A typical search came back with five that had "buy it now" prices ranging from $14 to $80. Each was unique, clearly hand made, with the style of the figure constituting the handle somewhat different, but all of a human form with an elaborate headdress carved from horn. The blades were crudely formed, probably from sheet metal, and all had "CHICHICASTENANGO" coarsely stuck with orthogonal blows and seemingly random accent marks. All came with similar leather sheaths, although curiously, one had a loop attached to it like this <a href="../../chapter-8/1910-sudanese-arm-dagger.html">Sudanese arm dagger</a>.</p>

<p>The piece from Artzi is in many ways similar to the cheap souvenir knives, but in other ways different, most notably in scale. It is not struck with the name of the town or with any other discernable marks. As with the knife, the handle and cross guard are carved horn. The handle of the knife is actually carved from three pieces of horn with the cross guard being a fourth. On the machete, although the handle is much larger, it is carved from just two pieces of horn. The leatherwork of the machete scabbard is nice quality but the blade is unremarkable. Artzi described it as double-edged, but it is hardly sharp at all (the knife is sharper). On the concave edge, the blade is only thin enough to be considered "sharpened" in the section that bellies out (the last 40% toward the tip), while it is "sharp" along about 80% of the backside. Is it really a "machete?" Native Central Americans did not have the technology to forge swords, so steel tools and weapons came to them with colonization. They were provided with machetes to work the plantations and cane fields, and with the revolutions these tools became weapons. In Central and South America, the word machete came to be a generic term for any long bladed weapon or tool. However, it is a fair question whether this piece saw any real use as either a weapon or a tool. I suspect that the answer is no. Although I imagine that it is possible that the blade might have once been attached to a less ornate, more practical handle, and as such served a true machete, I think it is likely that this was fashioned as an "super-souvenir," for a discerning tourist with sufficient room in their luggage to take home something nicer that the typical market offering. Lacking the stamped "Chichicastenango" it also becomes easier to pass off as a real native artifact.</p>

<p>What is the story of the figures represented on the handles of these pieces? The eBay vendors describe them variously as Mayan Gods or tribal chiefs. Searching for images of figurines and statues from Guatemala has not produced any strikingly similar figures. The Mayan Gods often have headdresses, but none that are as large as their entire bodies like they are on these pieces.  These designs may just be unique to the market at Chichicastenango. Perhaps an artist conceived the design sometime in the early twentieth century, it caught on, and other artists copied it. Was there an African influence? Certainly African slaves were brought to Central America, and some of their descendents, married with other Caribbean natives, are recognized as a distinct ethnic group known as the Garifuna. There is a small Garifuna population in Guatemala, part of a larger Afro-Guatemalan group constituting an estimated 3% of the total population of the country. It is possible, I suppose, that the first of these Chichicastenango knives were brought to the market not by a Mayan but by a craftsman of African decent.</p>
