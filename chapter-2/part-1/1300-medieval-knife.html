<div class="text">
<p>This is a knife that I purchased in an antique flea market in Amsterdam many years ago. My blacksmith/ knife maker friend Steve Bloom looked at it for me. He tells me that the blade is made of wrought iron and is at least 500 years old, and perhaps more likely as much as 700 years old. The age is indicated by the fact that it was made with high regard to the quality of construction yet is of a very early form of iron. Smelting is the basic process of extracting crude iron from its ore. It produces a bloom of metal that is then worked with heat and hammering to drive out cinder and slag and produce a compact and workable metal. This was the best that most smiths could do until the late Middle Ages, when methods were developed for making cast iron and steel.</p>

<p>This knife was clearly intended to be used at the dinner table or in the kitchen, and certainly was-probably for many hundreds of years. Even through the effects of the ages, the quality of its construction is evident. A knife of this sort usually just has a flat tang onto which the handle is attached, or a spike-like tang that runs through the handle and is held in place with a fitting at the pommel. The maker of this knife fashioned the base of the blade into a socket, and also fabricated a tang to go through the handle, so that the handle is doubly secured. The socket has a decorative trim line at the base, which is still visible on one side. The pride that the knife maker took in this piece is also evident in the presence of what appears to be the maker's mark, a star struck on one side of the blade. The wood is probably not original, another sign that this knife was cared for enough that at some point it was refit with a new handle. The thinness of the blade also imparts a feeling of elegance to the piece. This knife certainly could tell stories about life in the Middle Ages.</p>
