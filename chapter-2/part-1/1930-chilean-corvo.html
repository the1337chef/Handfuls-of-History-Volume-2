<p id="date">Circa 1930</p>

<div class="text">
<p> My education, formal institutional and subsequent self motivated, has left a gap in my understanding the historical basis for the South American nationalities, Brazil notwithstanding. I think of the South American nations sharing common language and religion, and similar Spanish colonial history. I appreciate that there is much more to the stories of the separate countries: details of their colonial beginning; differences in the indigenous peoples and their roles or exclusions from the national history; the geographic and mineral resources available; the political genesis of their independence; the political trajectory of their national governments through popular and military influences; communist revolutions and military dictatorships. These differences have given us the several existing nations rather than a United States of South America. Likewise, it has only been through the writing of my history books that I came to learn about the wars fought among the South American nations as they vied against one another for power and nationhood on their continent, wars like that of the Triple Alliance of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay against Paraguay (1864-1870), or the War of the Pacific between Chile and allied Bolivia and Peru (1879-1883). These wars consolidated the nationhood of the South American states, as typically occurs when a call to arms has been issued.</p>

<p>My interest in Chilean history was sparked by my purchase of this unusual knife. It had sat for many years unnoticed by me in a display case in a gun shop that I have visited dozens of times over the last ten years. Previously, I was looking only at the guns but now, working on this book, my search image had changed and I asked about this knife. All the owner of the shop could tell me was that he thought it had some association with South America. We struck a deal, he agreed to roughly a third the original asking price and I promised to tell him about the origins of the knife. I took it home and started my research. Within an hour, a reply on the ethnographic weapons forum gave me my answer. It is a Chilean Corvo. The Corvo is the "national knife" of Chile. Of course many countries, or more commonly ethnic groups, have associations with particular weapons, which forms a large basis for this book. What was it about this style of knife and Chile?</p>

<p>The history of Chile, from the Western perspective, began with its colonization by Spain in 1540 and independence in 1818, the same general time frame as for other Spanish-speaking South American nations. Also, as with other South-American states, there was a slow transition from elitist controlled restricted republics and dictatorships to a more modern democratic state, which for Chile was achieved only around 1990.</p>

<p>Spanish enthusiasm for the conquest of Chile was initially relatively low, since it did not offer the richness of gold that had been produced by the subjugation of Peru. However, the Spanish eventually came to appreciate Chile for its potential agricultural development. Nonetheless, Chile remained amongst the least economically rewarding of all of Spain's New World colonies. Chile was also the site of some of the most successful native resistance-the territories of the Mapuche people were never conquered by the Spanish and, in fact, the Mapuche people resisted assimilation by the independent Chilean nation until defeated by the national army in 1880.</p>

<p>Although now a modern developed and industrialized nation, historically the economy of Chile was based on agriculture. During the Spanish era Chile exported much of its produce to the Viceroyalty of Peru. Mining also became important in the nineteenth century, as Chile has some of the world's largest deposits of copper. There was also a silver mining rush between 1830 and 1850.</p>

<p>Another important industry to Chile in the 19th century was nitrate production. Nitrate was used for fertilizer and was also essential for making saltpeter, an ingredient for gunpowder. Peru's attempts to monopolize nitrate production led to the War of the Pacific, sometimes called the "Saltpeter War." The contested resource was in fact the residue of centuries of bird guano on islands and beaches of the Pacific coast. The war was preceded by a Spanish attempt to reassert their rights to the Chincha Islands. Peru and Chile allied themselves against Spain and defeated them in the Chincha Islands war (1864-1866). However, the question of who would ultimately profit from the victory was not resolved. Bolivia was also caught in the middle of the conflict, quite literally (or littorally, pun intended), since prior to the war, Bolivia's boundaries reached out to the Pacific Ocean through a section of the Atacama desert, the territory that was to be the focus of the dispute.</p>

<p>By the early 1870s the economies of both Chile and Peru were in trouble, as their agricultural and mining industries were in stiff competition with those of the U.S. This made the nitrate production all the more important. The Peruvian attempts to enforce a monopoly on the nitrate trade brought matters to a crisis and Chile declared war on Peru and Bolivia in 1879. The war concluded in 1883, a decisive victory for Chile. Not only did Bolivia concede their bit of coastline to Chile (making themselves ever since a landlocked nation), but Peru also ceded some of their southern territory to Chile.</p>

<p>The Chilean soldiers came to the war of the Pacific with their corvo knives. By this time the corvo had established itself as traditional item in Chilean culture. Two possible origins for the name have been suggested, the most likely being that corvo is simply the Spanish word for curved or hooked. However, it has also been suggested to relate to the Latin word for raven. A corvo would be carried and worn by men as part of the national costume, almost as an Arab would carry a Jambiya. Most historical corvos were, like this knife, only sharp on the inside (concave) edge. It is believed that they originated as tools used on the ranches or in the mines. It is speculated that they were useful to cut fuses, and certainly knives of this design would be useful to cut rope or cord with a single straight pulling movement. To accomplish the same act with a straight blade would require a back and forth sawing motion. Having the outside edge unsharpened would make the knives safer to use.</p>

<p>Part of the mythos about the use of the corvos knives by the Chilean soldiers during the War of the Pacific is that the soldiers would first work themselves up into a berserker-like state by consuming Chupilca del diablo (The Devil's Chupilca), a mixture of gunpowder and aguardiente (firewater). In any case, after the Chilean victory the Corvo became the official fighting knife of the Chilean soldier, although the ones made for <a href="../part-2/1950-chilean-military-corvo.html">military issue</a> were sharp on both edges.</p>

<p>There are many different corvo designs but they fall primarily into three groups: utilitarian working knives, dress knives, and military knives. This piece falls clearly in the dress category. Utilitarian knives tend to have simple grips of wood or horn. Fancy corvos like this one often have grips made of stacked disks of bone, bronze, wood, stone, or other materials. Presumably the stacks were first fused together with some sort of glue and then finished, usually into a rounded or oval shape. This knife is unusual in that the grip has a polygonal cross section. It also has a larger cross guard than is usual. The reinforcing diamond at the top of the blade is sometimes seen on other fancy corvos.</p>
