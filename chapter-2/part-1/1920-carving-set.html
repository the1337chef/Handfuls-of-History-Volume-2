<p id="date">Circa 1920</p>

<div class="text">
<p> These pieces are unique in that they were not acquired for the purpose of being in the collection, but rather they were acquired to be used and were purchased long before anything else in the book. The knife in this set is usually displayed on the wall in my home office, but at least twice a year it comes down to be used for its intended purpose on the Sunday roast or holiday turkey. Sets like this, complete with antler handles, are not uncommon-as a quick check on eBay will confirm. They go for anywhere from $10 to $300, depending on whether they can be associated with a famous maker or are anonymous. They were popular between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many were made in Sheffield, England, or Solingen, Germany, and these are among the most expensive. Some were mass produced with fake antler handles, and these are the cheapest. They often have distinctive bolsters, with the collars connecting the blades to the handles. On this set the bolsters are tarnished silver, lightly engraved cones, and I have not been able to match them to others I have seen for sale.</p>

<p>The knife has an unusual shape and angle, some of which might have been influenced by the piece of antler used for the handle, but I suspect the maker could have worked the antler differently to make a straighter joint if they wished. In any case, I find the angle of the blade is fine for the intended purpose. The blade itself is remarkably thin, even on the unsharpened backside. I would not want to try to use it as a cleaver but it is an excellent slicer. The sharpening steel that came with the set works very well to set the edge.</p>

<p>The fork is an interesting part of the set and the only piece that gave a clue to the origin of the set. Forks in sets like this often have a folding guard of some sort, even sets made well over 100 years ago. The fork in this set apparently has a folding guard of a somehow improved design that carries a patent mark of December 31, 1918. This patent, number US1289384A was granted to Walter L. Burritt and assigned to Ontario Knife Company of which Burritt was president. To quote from the patent:</p>

<p>"This invention relates to the devices employed for locking the folding guards of carving forks both in their folded and unfolded positions. Its object is the provision of a simple and durable spring-lock of this character which can be cheaply produced and which is at the same time practically invisible, rendering the fork neat and sightly in appearance."</p>

<p>The patent drawing shows a knife with a plain handle but the Ontario knife company might have used the lever design on different knife sets or they might have also licensed the patent to other makers. Arguably the former is more likely to be the case. The internet also produced the obituary of Mr. Burritt for me. He died on February 1, 1923, in Franklinville, New York of meningitis as a complication of  pneumonia. He founded the Ontario knife company in Franklinville in 1904. The local lodge of the Masons conducted his funeral. The Ontario Knife Company is still in business making cutlery, other knives, bayonets and tools. Their <a href="1940-hickory-butcher-knife.html">"Old Hickory"</a> line of knives are high carbon steel and made in the U.S., although they do also sell a line of stainless steel knives made in China.</p>

<p>This set was purchased in an antique mall in Florida around 1994. It appears that the knife may have been repaired at some time, since there is a line of glue visible at the joint of the bolster to the handle. I imagine that the folding guard could serve a safety function, though I have never felt the need for it. It also allows for the fork to be put down with the tines held off the table.</p>
